Mushroom Gravy

- 4 Tbsp butter
- 16 oz sliced mushrooms
- salt
Heat medium saucepan just enough so butter sizzles when it hits pan. Melt butter fully, then add mushrooms and add a pinch of salt. Cook for about 20 minutes until mushrooms give up their liquid and liquid evaporates off.

- 1/4 cup flour
Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes.

- 1 quart beef stock
Add a slash of beef stock and stir until uniform. Repeat gradually, with more and more stock each time, until all of the stock is added.

- pepper
- 1 shake dried thyme
Add pepper and thyme, stir to make uniform. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a bare simmer. Cook, stirring often, for about 30 minutes.
