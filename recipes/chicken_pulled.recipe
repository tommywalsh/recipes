Quick Pulled Chicken

- 1 cup homemade chicken broth (or store-bought plus 1 tsp gelatin)
- 2 Tbsp molasses
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp liquid smoke
- 1 tsp salt
Stir to dissolve in a dutch oven over high heat, and bring to a simmer

- 2 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs
Cut each thigh in half (don’t trim fat). Place chicken in pot and stir.
Lower heat to a bare simmer, cover and braise for 25 minutes, until chicken pulls apart easily.

Move chicken pieces to a large bowl to cool a bit.  Bring braising liquid to a boil and reduce by about a half.

When chicken has cooled enough to work with, shred it by pulling with two forks.

- About ½ cup store-bought BBQ sauce
Put sauce in a small saucepan, and strain in reduced braising liquid. Bring to a simmer and reduce
to desired consistency.

Pour a bit of the sauce into the chicken and stir to mix. Add more sauce as necessary so chicken is of desired moistness.

- Sandwich rolls
- Fritos (optional)
- Sliced jack cheese (optional)
Make into sandwiches and serve, with remaining sauce on the side.
