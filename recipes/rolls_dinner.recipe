Dinner Rolls

- 3 Tbsp butter
Soften butter to room temperature, preferably by leaving out overnight. Microwave can be used, but be very careful not to melt any.

- 45g milk
- 45g water
- 15g all-purpose flour
In a small saucepan, bring milk and water just barely to a boil. Whisk in the fliour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds or so until thick and not lumpy.  Transfer to stand mixer bowl and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

- 110g milk
Slowly warm milk in the microwave, just until temperature is at 85F. Do not allow to scald or boil.

- 325g all-purpose flour
- 50g sugar
- 5g yeast
- 8g salt
- 1 egg
Add flour, sugar, yeast, salt and egg to the stand mixer with the paste. Also add in the warmed milk. Mix on medium-low speed until combined.

With mixer still going at medium-low speed, gradually add the softened butter, 1 small piece at a time.

After all butter is fully combined, increase speed to high for 1 minute.

Turn out dough to a floured countertop. Dust top with flour, cover with plastic, and allow to rise at room temperature for about 90 minutes.

Cover bottom of an 8x8 pan with parchment.

Divide into 9 equal pieces (about 75g each). Roll each piece into a tight ball. Arrange balls, seam side down, in the 8x8 pan.

Cover rolls with plastic and allow to proof for 90 additional minutes at room temperature. Alternatively, you may shorten the room temperature time to about 1 hour, and then store unbaked rolls in the fridge overnight.

Preheat oven to 350F

- 1 Egg
- 1 Tbsp water
Whisk together egg and water until no longer gloppy. Brush tops of rolls with egg wash. Back for 20-30 minutes until desired level of brown.

- 2 Tbsp butter
Melt butter. Brush rolls with butter when they come out of the oven.
