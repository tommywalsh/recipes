Magic Bars

- 1 stick butter
Bring butter up to room temperature, either by leaving it out for a few hours, or by carefully heating in the microwave for 5 second bursts.

Preheat oven to 350F. Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch-square baking pan with parchment paper.

- 70 g pecans
Pulse in a food processor just to a chopped consistency. Set aside.

- 120 g graham crackers
Pulse in a food processor until reduced to crumbs. Set aside.

- 150 g brown sugar
In a stand mixer on medium, cream together the softened butter with the brown sugar, until smooth and combined (about 2 minutes). Scrape the sides and paddle periodically.

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg
Add extract and egg to the creamed butter mixture, and beat until combined.

- 125g flour
- 1/2 tsp table salt
- 175 g butterscotch chips
+ graham cracker crumbs
Add flour, salt, butterscotch chips, and graham cracker crumb to butter mixture, and mix on slow speed just until well-combined into a dough.

Press the dough evenly into the lined pan. Bake for 5 minutes, and then remove from oven.

- 180 g semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 55 g shredded sweetened coconut
+ chopped pecans
Sprinkle the chips, coconut, and pecans evenly over the partially-cooked dough.

- 70 g sweetened condensed milk
Drizzle the condensed milk over top. Try to do this roughly evenly, but don't sweat it too much, as the milk will flow to even itself out as it heats up.

Bake for 15 minutes, then loosely cover with aluminum foil. Continue cooking for 15 more minutes or so, until set.

Allow the bars to cool at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, then refrigerate until the bottom of the pan is fully cold. At that point, pull up on the parchment to remove the bars from the pan.

Cut into bars of whatever desired size. These will keep at room temperature for a week or so. They can be frozen for 3 months or so.
