Greek Pizza

- 400g bread flour
- 1 tsp instant yeast
- 1 Tbsp kosher salt
- 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 260 g water
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, and salt. Add oil and water, and stir just until combined. Cover with plastic wrap and leave out at room temperature overnight.

- 2 cloves garlic
Use a microplane grater to make a paste out of the garlic

- 28 oz crushed tomatoes
Separate the tomatoes into 2/3 and 1/3 portions.

- 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
Heat oil in a skillet or small saucepan until shimmering. Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes. Stir just until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

- 1 tsp tomato paste
Stir in tomato paste and cook for about 1 minute.

Add in 2/3 of crushed tomatoes, reduce heat to very low and cook for about an hour.  Note that this makes much more sauce than is needed for two pizzas. Excess can be frozen.

- salt
Add remaining crushed tomatoes, and season to taste with salt.  Sauce can be refrigerated for a few days if desired.

Two hours before cooking, separate dough into two equal parts, and stretch each into a tight ball.  Put each ball into its own oiled bowl, cover, and let rest at room temperature for about an hour

- shortning
- olive oil
One hour before cooking, pre-heat oven to 500F. Generously grease a cast-iron (or stainless) skillet with shortning, then add about 1 Tbsp oil.  Stretch a dough ball flat, and place in the skillet, atop the oil.  Stretch out the dough to cover the whole bottom (you might have to stretch more than once, letting the dough rest for a few minutes in between)
Let rest on the counter for about an hour.  Either do the same with the other dough ball, or refrigerate the other one for up to 3 days, then let warm and resume with this step.

- 8 oz whole-milk mozzerella (not pre-shredded!)
- 8 oz white cheddar (not pre-shredded!)
- 2 oz parm-regg cheese
- Any desired toppings
Use a food processor to shred the cheese. Just before cooking, spread sauce over dough, to within 1/2 inch of edge. Cover with shredded cheese, and add any toppings.  (If not cooking both pizzas now, cheese can be stored covered in fridge for a few days)

Cook in 500F oven for about 15-20 minutes until cheese is starting to brown.  Use a thin spatula to release crust from sides and check underneath. If more browning is needed, do it over low heat on the cooktop.  Let pizza rest for 3 minutes on cutting board before cutting.
