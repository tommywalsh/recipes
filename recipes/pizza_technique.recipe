Pizza Technique

- Toppings
Ideas for toppings include: mushrooms and green peppers; roasted squash, roasted grapes, and goat cheese with white sauce; clams and bacon with white sauce; pepperoni; ham, pineapple, and salad cerries.
If a topping contains an appreciable amount of water (e.g. veggies and fruits), then it's best to cook them before the pizza.  Otherwise, they will give off water and make the pizza soggy.
To roast squash and grapes: toss them in oil, arrange on sheet, sprinkle salt and dried rosemary, bake in preheated 450F oven for 30 mins, turning halfway through.
To pre-cook veggies: sweat on stovetop with a little butter and some salt until they release their water. Optionally brown them if you like.

- Pizza dough (see "overnight pizza dough recipe")
If dough is cold, leave it out (covered) at room temperature for a couple of hours before cooking.

+ 2 pizza stones
Place one shelf at top of oven, and the other in the middle. Place each pizza stone on a wire rack atop a baking sheet, and put one on each shelf.  Pre-heat oven (and stones) to 550F for at least an hour before cooking

- Pizza sauce (Classico is a good brand, also see "white pizza sauce" recipe)
- Shredded pizza cheese
Stretch dough to desired size and shape. As you finish, have a helper remove the upper stone/sheet from the oven. Place dough directly on hot stone. Cover with sauce, then cheese, then any toppings.  Place stone/sheet back onto top rack.  Cook for about 6 minutes until crust is starting to char.

Remove stone/sheet from oven and transfer pizza onto cutting board. Move the other stone to the top rack (for pizza #2), and place the recently-used one back onto the other shelf (to heat back up for pizza #3).

- Pizza cutter
Allow pizza to sit for about a minute, then cut into individual pieces.

Repeat, cycling the stones between oven shelves, as many times as you want. Always cook the pizza on the top shelf.
