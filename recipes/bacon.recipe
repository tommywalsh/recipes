Bacon Technique

- 1 package bacon
Cut unopened package in half crosswise, splitting each piece of bacon in the middle.
This prevents stretching the bacon as you pull the pieces apart
Arrange halved bacon slices on a baking sheet (use two sheets for whole package)

Put sheets of bacon into cold oven. Set oven to 400F.

Cook for 15-25 minutes, depending on how crunchy you want it.

Put bacon slices on paper towels to drain.

Store cooked bacon in a zip-top bag in fridge for later use.
Optionally, save grease ("bacon butter") for later use
