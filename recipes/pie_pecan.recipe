Pecan Pie

- 1 pie crust
Prepare pie crust recipe, and place in a 9-inch pie plate. Refrigerate, covered, for an hour or so.

Preheat oven to 375F

Crust might need to be partially pre-baked. This pie bakes for about 45 minutes, and the crust might need longer. If so, dock the crust with a fork, then line the crust with aluminum foil, then fill with sugar. Bake until time difference is made up.

- 1/3 cup butter
Melt butter, but don't let it sizzle or brown.

- 133 grams sugar (2/3 cup)
- 1 cup corn syrup
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 eggs
In a medium bowl, mix these ingredients thoroughly using a hand mixer. Add melted butter and mix again with hand mixer.

- 1 cup pecan halves
Stir pecan halves into filling. Pour filling into crust. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.

Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.
