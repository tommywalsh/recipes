Overnight Pizza Dough

- 470g bread dough
- 25g sugar
- 1/2 tsp yeast
Combine dough, sugar, yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk until evenly combined.

- 285g cold water
Add water to flour mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon until dough mostly comes together (no need to make it homogenous).  Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 15 minutes.

- 9g salt
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
Add salt and oil to the dough. Use the stand mixer to knead for about 15 minutes, until dough passes the "window pane" test.

Oil a large bowl. Form dough into ball and place in oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

About two hours before cooking, separate dough into three roughly-equal pieces. Form them into a ball, place them on a floured surface, cover with plastic wrap and let them warm up for a couple of hours before cooking.
