Rice Technique

Note: This is not a recipe.  This is just a rough technique that can be adapted to various styles of rice.

- fat (neutral oil, butter, bacon fat)
- chopped raw vegetables and/or meats (optional)
- salt (optional)
Heat fat in medium saucepan. If using meats, brown them in the fat, then remove. If using vegetables, sweat them with salt.

- long-grain rice (jasmine, basmati, etc.)
Add rice to hot fat/veggies and toast for a minute or two.

- cooking liquid (water, broth, etc.)
Add water to rice (rice package will say how much). Bring to a boil, then lower heat and cover. Keep heat adjusted so that liquid is at a bare simmer. Cook just until liquid is absorbed (15-25 minutes).

- chopped cooked vegetables and/or meats
- herbs
- spices
Mix in any additional items. Fluff rice with a fork, recover, and allow to sit off-heat for 5 minutes.
