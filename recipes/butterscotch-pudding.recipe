Butterscotch Pudding

- 12 Tbsp butter
Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Don't let it sizzle.


- 1/2 cup sugar
- 3.5 oz dark brown sugar
- 2 Tbsp light corn syrup
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 3/4 tsp table salt
Add all to melted butter, and bring to a full rolling boil, stirring occastionally. Caramel should be about 240F at this stage.

Reduce heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until caramel has developed to the desired level. For more complex, slightly bitter flavor, bring caramel to 300F. For sweeter, simpler flavor, stop at about 280F.  Meanwhile, prepare dairy and immersion blender for next step.

- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 cups milk
Remove caramel from heat, pour in about 1/4 of the heavy cream, and swirl to combine. Use immersion blender for about 30 seconds, making sure to get all the corners of the pan.  Return saucepan to medium heat, and gradually whisk in remaining cream. Add milk and whisk until smooth. Keep on medium heat, but don't allow to fully boil.

- 4 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup corn starch
- 1/4 cup milk
In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks and corn starch until smooth and uniform. Microwave milk until simmering. Gradually whisk all of the hot milk into the egg mixture, and set aside at room temperature.

Return cream/caramel mixture to a full rolling boil, whisking frequently. Once a full boil is reached, dump the entire contents into the egg mixture at once. Immediately whisk thoroughly for 10 to 15 seconds. Mixture should thicken.

- 2 tbsp vanilla
- 1 splash rum (optional)
Whisk in vanilla and rum until uniform. Spray a piece of plastic wrap with vegetable oil, and press the plastic right down onto the surface of the pudding, so that no air is touching the surface. Place another layer of plastic wrap over the top of the bowl.

- whipped cream
Refrigerate until fully chilled, at least 3 hours. Serve with whipped cream.
