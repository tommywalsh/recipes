Clam Chowder

- 1 medium onion
- 2 stalks celery
- 500g Yukon Gold potatoes (about 3)
Peel and dice the onion and potato. Dice the celery.

- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2 cups milk
Combine milk and cream and store in the fridge until needed.

- 2 cans (13oz total) chopped clams
Drain clams, reserving liquid.

- salt
- pepper or white pepper
- cooked bacon

- 2 Tbsp butter
In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, melt 2 Tbsp butter just until it starts to bubble.
Add onions and celery and a pinch of salt.
Sweat until onion softens and just starts to become a bit translucent. Be careful not to brown the vegetables.

- about 1 cup chicken broth and/or water
Add clam juice and potatoes to the vegetables.
Add just enough broth/water to cover.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a bare simmer. Allow to simmer for at least 10 minutes.

- 10 Tbsp butter
- 90g all-purpose flour
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt remaining 10 Tbsp butter until it starts to bubble.
Add flour and whisk until uniform.
Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture starts to smell like pastry dough, about 2-3 minutes.
Be careful to use low enough heat so that the mixture does not brown.

Gradually add the chilled cream mixture. Add a splash, then whisk until uniform, then add another splash and repeat. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, then remove from heat.

Add cream mixture to the vegetable mixture. Add clams. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly and thoroughly to try to avoid developing a skin that sticks to the bottom. If a skin does develop, leave it alone and do not try to scrape it up into the chowder.

Reduce heat to a bare simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper (use white pepper if you really want the chowder as white as possible). Cook until the potatoes are tender, stirring regularly to try to avoid a bottom skin. This could take anywhere from 0-15 minutes.

- cooked bacon
Serve with crumbed bacon on top.
