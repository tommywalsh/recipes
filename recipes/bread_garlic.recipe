Garlic Bread

- 4 tbsp butter
Soften butter fully, by leaving out at room temperature for a few hours, or my carefully microwaving.

- 1 clove garlic
- 1/4 tsp table salt
- 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes
Mince garlic. 
Combine butter, garlic, salt, seasoning, and pepper in a small bowl. Stir/mash until uniformly mixed.

- 1/2 loaf of soft Italian bread
Cut the half-loaf into two pieces, the long way, maximizing the amount of non-crust surface.
Evenly spread the butter onto the bread.

Set broiler to high. Place bread a few inches under the broiler, and broil briefly, just until bread browns but does not burn.
