Arancini Technique

This is best made with leftover risotto that has been refrigerated. To make from scratch, simply make risotto as usual, then spead it out on a plate and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to cool.

- Oil
Heat oil in a wok or large saucepan, deep enough to cover anacini balls, until between 350F and 400F. Hold in this temp range.

- Low-moisture mozzerella, optionally smoked (or another kind of cheese)
Grab 1 or 2 small chunks of cheese, wrap with chilled risotto and form into a ball. Set aside. Repeat using all of the risotto.

- Flour
- Egg(s)
- Panko
Make a breading station with 3 bowls, one each for flour, egg, and panko, and a rack set over a baking sheet.  Whisk egg very well.

Coat a ball with flour, then egg, then panko. Place ball onto the rack, and repeat with all other balls.

- Salt
Working in batches of 3-4 balls at a time, deep-fry for 6 minutes, holding temp near 350F, until exterior is nicely browned and crisp. Remove from oil to rack and sprinkle with salt. Allow to drip dry and cool slightly before serving.

- Marinara sauce (optional)
Serve hot, optionally with dipping sauce.

To reheat, use microwave in 2 30-second bursts to heat balls internally. This will make the coating soggy, so then deep-fry at 350F for 3 minutes or so until coating is re-crisped, but not so long as to burn it.
