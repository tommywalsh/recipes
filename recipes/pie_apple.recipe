Apple Pie

- 225g brown sugar (about 1 packed cup)
- 2.5 tsp ground cinnamon
- 3/4 tsp kosher salt (or 3/8 tsp regular salt)
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg and cloves.


- 4.25 pounds tart apples such as Granny Smith (about 8 large apples)
Peel, quarter, and core apples, then slice into 1/2-inch wedges.
Use crank tool to peel only -- if you also slice/core, the apples will turn to mush.

Measure 1.45kg of sliced apples (discard the rest).
Add apples and spice mixture to a gallon zip-top bag, alternating layers of apples and spices.
Seal tightly, and tumble until roughly coated.
Allow bag of apples to rest at room temperature until they have lost 1/3 of their volume (about 3.5 hours).
Flip the bag occasionally to distribute the syrup.
After this step, apples can be stored in fridge for up to 8 hours, if needed, before assembling the pie.


- 25g tapioca starch
Add tapioca starch to apples, reseal, and toss to combine throughly.

- Enough pie crust for full top and bottom of 9" pan.
Pour contents of bag into a bottom crust that is fitted into a 9" pie pan.
Nestle the slices as needed to somewhat flatten out the mound of apples.
Let full top crust stand at room temperature until it's flexible, then drape over apples.
Pinch the top and bottom crust together to seal at the plate edge.
Trim both crusts to 3/4 inch, and tuck the dough under itself.

Refrigerate prepared pie for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400F.


- 1 egg
- 1 Tbsp heavy cream
- 1/8 tsp kosher salt (or 1/16 regular salt)
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, cream and salt.
Brush over the chilled pie in a thin even layer.
With a sharp knife, cut five or six 3-inch vents in the top crust, wiggling the knife so that the vents do not seal themselves closed.

Place pie on a parchment-lined aluminum half-sheet pan. Bake until the very center filling is at 195F (about 75 minutes).
Cool at least one hour before serving.
