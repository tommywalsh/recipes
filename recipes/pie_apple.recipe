Apple Pie

- 225g brown sugar (about 1 packed cup)
- 2.5 tsp ground cinnamon
- 3/4 tsp kosher salt (or 3/8 tsp regular salt)
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg and cloves.

- 4.25 pounds tart apples such as Granny Smith (about 8 large apples)
Peel apples (if you have an old-timey crank tool, it's okay to use this to peel... but do not use it to core/slice the apples, as the pieces will be too small and they will turn to mush). Core each apple and cut into 8 slices, then cut each slice into three pieces, removing any pieces of core that might remain.

Measure 1.45kg (3.2 pounds) of sliced apples. Discard any remaining, or use them as a snack.
Add apples and spice mixture to a gallon zip-top bag, alternating layers of apples and spices.
Seal tightly, and tumble until roughly coated.
Allow bag of apples to rest at room temperature until they have lost 1/3 of their volume (about 3.5 hours).
Flip the bag occasionally to distribute the syrup.
After this step, apples can be stored in fridge for up to 8 hours, if needed, before assembling the pie.


- 25 grams tapioca starch
Add tapioca starch to apples, reseal, and toss to combine throughly.

- 2 pie crusts 
Put one crust into a 9" pie pan. Pour apple mixure in gradually, and nestle the slices as necessary to try to flatten down the mound of apples.
Let full top crust stand at room temperature until it's flexible, then drape over apples.
Pinch the top and bottom crust together to seal at the plate edge.
Trim both crusts to 3/4 inch, and tuck the dough under itself, so it does not overhang the edge of the pie pan.

Refrigerate prepared pie for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400F.

- 1 egg
- 1 Tbsp heavy cream or milk
- 1/8 tsp kosher salt (or 1/16 regular salt)
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, cream and salt.
Brush over the chilled pie in a thin even layer.
With a sharp knife, cut five or six 3-inch vents in the top crust, wiggling the knife to open the vents and prevent them from re-closing.

Place pie on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake until the temperature at the very center is 195F (about 75 minutes).

Cool to 85F before serving.
