Stovetop Burgers

- 4 oz 80/20 ground beef per burger
Measure out beef into 2 oz balls.

- buns
- any desired toppings
Before you begin cooking, arrange all toppings on buns. Burgers will cook very quickly, and there will be no time later.

Heat large skillet over medium high heat until quite hot

- salt
- pepper
- cooking spray
+ grill weight
+ stiff metal turner
Spray grill weight thoroughly. Drop two balls of meat into pan, then use the grill weight to press them down very thin. Twist the weight back and forth as you do this, and remove the weight by twisting, not pulling straight up (otherwise the meat will stick).  Season each patty with salt and pepper.

- American cheese slices (one per burger)
When tops of patties start to lose their pink color, flip them. Use the turner upside-down to scrape each one off of the pan in one piece. Put a slice of cheese onto the second patty that you flip.  

Let them cook for only about 10 seconds, then put the first patty atop the second patty so the cheese is in the middle.  Cook only until cheese is melted.

Place stacked burgers into bun and serve immediately.
