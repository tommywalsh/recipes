Sausage Ragu

Hot italian can be substituted for all/some of the sweet, but beware: because this cooks so long, the dish will be very spicy. Plain diced tomatoes can be substituted for the Italian-style: just add a pinch of Italian seasoning.

- 1 lb sweet italian sausage
- 1 small red onion
- 1 rib celery
- 2 cloves garlic
If sausage is in link form, remove meat from casing. Mince the onion and celery.  Finely mince garlic.

- 1 Tbsp olive oil
Heat oil in skillet until shimmering. Add sausage meat. Cook sausage, occasionally breaking apart with spoon, until well-browned, about 10 minutes.

Add celery and onion to sausage, and cook until vegetables are translucent, about 8 more minutes

Clear a space in the middle of the skillet and add garlic. Cook garlic just until fragrant 1-2 minutes.

- 1/2 cup red wine
Transfer contents of skillet into a slow cooker, and return skillet to medium-low heat. Add wine, a little at a time, using it to scrape up anything that is stuck to the bottom of the skillet.


- 14 oz Italian-style diced tomatoes (or plain + pinch of italian seasoning)
- 14 oz tomato sauce
Pour wine, tomatoes and sauce into slow cooker. Cook, covered, on low for 4-5 hours.

- salt
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
Add cream, and salt to taste. Cool for an additional hour

- 1lb dried pasta, such as ziti
Cook pasta according to package directions in a pot of salted water.  Try to time this so it finishes at the same time as the sauce.  Drain pasta in colander (remove it from pot)

Put the sauce into the pasta pot. Check the seasoning and consistency. If it's too thin, boil it down a bit; if it's too thin, add some water or chicken broth.  Mix in pasta.
