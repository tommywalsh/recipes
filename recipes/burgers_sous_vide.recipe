Sous Vide Burgers

Preheat immersion cooker to 54C.

- 1/2 lb 80/20 ground beef per burger
Lightly pack beef into a single patty. The thicker, the better.  Season both sides with salt and pepper. Place into a zip-top plastic bag and place in immersion cooker. Cook for at least 40 minutes, at most 4 hours.

Remove bags from cooker. Remove burgers from bags, and let rest for 10 minutes, with paper towels over and under the patties.

- buns
- toppings
Prepare buns with any toppings you want on the burgers. Get this ready ahead of time so you can serve immediately

- cheese (optional)
Place a thin layer of vegetable oil in a skillet and heat on high until just barely smoking.  Season patties with salt and pepper again, and place them in the hot skillet. Wait for the bottom of the pattie to brown (1-2 minutes), then flip the patties and top them with cheese.  After the other side is browned, place them on prepared buns and serve immediately.
