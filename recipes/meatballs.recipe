Preheat oven to 450F.
Place two wire racks on two baking sheets.

- 6oz prosciutto
- 3oz parm-regg cheese
- 3 garlic cloves
- 3 egg
Meanwhile, grate cheese. Finely mince garlic and prosciutto. Beat egg. Reserve all of these ingredients separately.


- 1/2 Tbsp gelatin
- 3 Tbsp cold water
Dissolve gelatin in water

- 2 lb 85/15 ground beef
- 1 lb ground pork
- 1/2 Tbsp table salt
- 2 Tbsp dried parsley
Add beef, port, salt, parsley, gelatin mixture, grated cheese, minced garlic, minced prosciutto, and beaten egg to the breadcrumb mixture. Mix throughouly with hands until fully combined.

Coat racks very well with cooking spray.  Form mixture into about 30-35 meatballs (each will be about 1/4 cup). Space meatballs evenly on racks. Roast in oven for about 30 minutes, rotating halfway through, until meatballs are browned.
