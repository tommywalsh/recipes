Scotch Pies

- 400 g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp table salt
Mix together in a large bowl

- 2/3 cup water
- 7 Tbsp butter
- 100 g lard
Place water in small saucepan over low heat. Add butter and lard and melt. Bring to a bare simmer.

Pout hot water/fat mixture into flour mixture and stir with handle of a wooden spoon, just enough so that no separate liquid remains.
Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead gently until dough is one homogenous piece.

Cut dough into two pieces, one twice as big as the other.
Cover in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least two hours or overnight.

- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion
- Salt
Finely dice onion. Heat oil in a large frying pan that has a lid. Sweat the onions along with a pinch of salt until soft.

- 1 tsp mace
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning
- 500 g 80/20 ground lamb or beef (or a mix)
Add spices to onion and stir. Add lamb and stir to break up. Cook until well browned.

- 2 cups beef or lamb broth
- 2 small bay leaves
Add stock and bay leaves to meat mixture and bring to a boil. Cover with a lid, lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

Strain out stock into a bowl, glass or jug. Remove bay leaves. Cover meat mixture and allow to cool. Skim fat off of liquid and discard fat.

Preheat oven to 340F.

+ 4 small pie tins, approximately 4-inch diameter, 1-inch deep.
Thoroughly grease pie tins with lard (butter, oil or shortening also works)
Roll out large clump of dough, and cut out four 5-inch circles to be the pie bases. Similarly, roll out small clump and cut out 4-inch circles to be the tops. Cut out small holes in the center of each top. Adjust sizes to fit your pie tins.
Place dough bases into the pie tins. Press them into place snugly, right down into the corners. Make sure to leave some sticking out over top of the tins.
Fill each tin with meat, lightly compacting it down. Fill right up to the top.
Make a small hole in the center of each pie with a spoon handle. Pour in a little stock (about 3/4 tsp per pie)

- 1 egg
- 1 dash milk
Beat egg and milk together. Brush egg wash all around the edge of the dough in the tins. Brush the undersides of the lids also.
Place lids on pies and gently press them down. Crimp the lids and bases together all around the pies.
Brush tops of pies with the egg wash.
Bake for 40 minutes

- 2 Tbsp butter
Pour reserved skimmed stock into a small saucepan, add butter and heat up until butter melts, but liquid is not yet boiling.

- 1 tsp corn starch
- 2 Tbsp water
Combine corn starch and water in a small sealable container and shake vigorously to thoroughly mix. Add slurry gradually to stock until desired consistency is reached.
Bring to a bare simmer, put a lid on, and simmer for 5 minutes.

When pies are done baking, remove them from tins, and serve hot with gravy.
