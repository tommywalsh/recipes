Poutine Gravy

- 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1.5 Tbsp cornstarch
In a medium bowl, whisk chicken broth and cornstarch until no lumps remain. You may choose to gradually run the cornstarch through a sifter as you whisk to make it easier to get it smooth.

- 4 Tbsp butter
- 1/4 cup flour
Melt butter in a medium saucepan. Whisk in flour and cook for at least 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

- 2.5 cups low-sodium beef broth
Gradually add beef broth, starting with just a splash, stirring to make uniform. Continue, adding more and more beef broth until it's all gone.

- 1 Tbsp ketchup
- 1 Tbsp cider vinegar
- 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp dried parsley
- 1 tsp granulated beef boullion or 1 small cube of frozen demi-glace
- 1/2 tsp parsley
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp table salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1/4 tsp oregano
- 1/4 tsp thyme
Add chicken broth mixture, then all remaining ingredients. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer to desired thickness.

Remove from heat and adjust seasoning as desired.
