Baked Ham

- 1 ham, any size (avoid "water added" hams)
Remove any plastic wrapper(s) from the ham. Place into a large zipper bag, seal the bag and place it into a bucket or large pot.  Cover with hot water.  Allow ham to warm up to room temperature. The larger the ham, the longer this will take. Refreshing the hot water can help.

Preheat oven to 275F, and put rack low in the oven.

- 1-1/2 cup cola (1 can)
- 1-1/2 cup grape juice or grape soda
Pat ham dry, and cut a deep crosshatch pattern into the top of the ham. Place ham into a baking dish that's at least an inch deep. Mix cola and grape juice, then pour the mixture into the baking dish until the liquid is at least 1/2 inch deep.

Place baking dish onto a baking sheet, and tightly cover the dish with foil. Roast in oven until center of ham reaches 100F (about 15 mins per pound).

- 1 cup cola
- 1 cup grape juice
- 20oz can sliced pineapple
- 425g brown sugar
Empty pineapple juice into a medium saucepan and reserve pineapple slices. Add cola, grape juice, and brown sugar to saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then simmer to concentrate the liquid down. You want the liquid to be thick (not runny, not solidified) when warm. Let sauce sit at room temperature until ham comes out of oven.

When ham reaches 100F, remove it from the oven, and remove foil. Increase oven temperature to 425F.  When oven reaches temperature, brush sauce all over ham and put ham back in oven.  Every ten minutes, check ham temperature, and re-brush with more sauce.  Remove ham from oven when top is well-browned and when ham is about 140F.

When ham comes out of oven, remove it from baking dish, and let rest on a cutting board for 15 minutes.

- salad cherries (optional)
Cut pineapple slices into chunks. Add pineapple and optinally cherries to sauce.  Sauce can be spooned onto ham at the table.
