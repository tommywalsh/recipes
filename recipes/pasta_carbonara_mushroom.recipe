Mushroom Carbonara

Fill a large pot with water and season well with a few big pinches of salt. Bring to a boil and keep at a simmer.

- 1Â½ lb. crimini or button mushrooms
- 6 garlic cloves
- 2 medium shallots
Tear off and discard mushroom stems. Keep the caps and tear each one into 2-4 pieces.
Peel and thinly slice garlic
Peel and finely chop shallots.

- 4 oz Parmesan or Parg-Regg cheese (pregrated is okay)
Grate cheese using chopping blade of food processor (not shredding disk)

- 6 large eggs
- 3g freshly-ground pepper
Separate 5 eggs and discard whites. Whisk together the 5 yolks with the other whole egg, the grated cheese, and the pepper.

- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high for a good 3 minutes until very very hot.
Add oil and mushrooms to pan then toss.
Mushrooms will cook for about 13-16 minutes, giving off lots of water at first before they start browning.

- 1 lb small shells or similar
While mushrooms are cooking, cook pasta in the boiling water for 2 minutes less than al dente.
Save the used pasta water!

- 1.5 tsp kosher salt
When mushrooms have fully browned, add garlic shallots and salt.
Cook, stirring, for about a minute until shallots are softened but not browned.

Add pasta and 1 cup of pasta water to mushrooms.
Stir and cook over medium heat for two minutes.
Then, remove from heat and let cool for 1 minute

Gradually add 1/4 cup of pasta water to egg mixture, whisking as you go.
While stirring the pasta vigorously, slowly drizzle in the egg mixture.
If needed, you can add a little bit of pasta water if the sauce is too thick.
