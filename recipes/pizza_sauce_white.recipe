White Pizza Sauce

- 1 Tbsp butter
Melt butter in small saucepan, and heat until bubbling.

- 3 Tbsp flour
Add flour to butter, and whisk/stir until a uniform paste is formed. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until the raw flour smell is replaced by a pie crust smell (about 3 minutes).

- 1.25 cups milk
Add a splash of milk. It will sputter in the pan. Whisk it into the flour paste until uniform. Repeat. Keep going until all the milk is in the pan.  Generally, you can add larger quantities of milk as you go, but don't add too much, as you might get lumps.

- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1 pinch kosher salt
- 1 pinch pepper
Add spices to milk mixture, then bring to a boil. Adjust heat to maintain a light boil for 3 minutes. Stir constantly, and cover the entire bottom of the bowl (otherwise milk solids will stick to the bottom of the pan and scortch)

17g grated parmesan cheese
Remove sauce from heat, add cheese, and stir until melted.  Allow to cool a bit. Sauce spreads best when it is warm but not hot.
