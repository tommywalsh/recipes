Pretzels (or Pretzel Danishes)

This is a 2- or 3-day recipe

- 80g bread flour
- 1/4 tsp instant yeast
- 1/3 cup room-temperature water
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and yeast. Add water and stir with a wooden spoon until fully combined and no dry spots remain. Cover tightly, and let sit in a warm area for 3-4 hours, until starter dough is bubbly and has expanded by about half.  Refrigerate starter overnight.

- 1 Tbsp butter
Melt butter and then let cool a little bit (but not so much that it solidifies)

- 90g warm water (90F)
Add water and melted butter to the bowl with the starter. Stir until mostly uniform.

- 245g bread flour
- 1 heaping tsp kosher salt
In a large bowl, combine flour and salt and stir to combine. Add starter mixture and stir until roughly combined. Knead by hand until a uniform shaggy dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in a warm area for 30 minutes.

After the rest, hand-knead dough in the bowl just until uniform, about 15-30 seconds. Recover with plastic and let sit for 2-4 hours until puffy and expanded by about half.

Cut dough into 6 equal pieces.  (If you are making danishes, then roll one of these pieces into a ball, cover with plastic, and reserve for later)

Roll each piece into a log and seal the lengthwise seam closed (do not seal the ends).

On a clean unfloured surface, roll a log into a snake 24 inches long. Repeat with all six pieces and cover with plastic. Allow snakes to rest for about 10 minutes, during which time they will likely shrink in length. 

Arrange a silicone mat on a baking sheet.  Grab a snake and roll it back out to at least 24 inches.  Arrange the snake into an inverted U shape, with the legs pointing towards you. Cross the two legs over themselves twice. Fold the legs back up onto the loop part. Adjust until all three “holes” in the pretzel are about equal. Press the tips of the legs to seal them down. Place the pretzel onto the silicone mat.  Repeat with all of the snakes.

(If you are making danishes, then roll out the reserved dough ball. Keep rolling until the dough is quite thin and is big enough for all of the pretzels to fit on. Using wet hands, dampen the surface of the dough sheet and the bottom of the pretzels. Press each pretzel down onto the sheet to "glue" it in place on bottom of the pretzel.  Finally, run a sharp knife along the edges and discard the remains of the dough sheet.)

Cover the pretzels with something that will not touch the dough logs: plastic wrap if possible, or else use an upside-down baking sheet and use plastic to seal the interface between the two baking sheets.  Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.

Put rack in middle of oven and preheat to 400F. Remove cover from pretzels, and let them sit uncovered in fridge for 30 minutes.

- 30g food-grade lye (Sodium Hydroxide)
- 3 cups water
Put on long sleeves, rubber gloves and safety glasses. Place water in a non-reactive bowl. Sprinkle lye into water. For safety reasons, always add lye to water, not water to lye!  Wait for lye to dissolve in the water. You can stir very lightly with a wooden or plastic spoon to speed this along, but be very careful to not splash any of this corrosive solution onto yourself or onto your countertop.

Place a sheet of parchment on a baking sheet, then a cooling rack on top of that. Spray rack well with non-stick spray.  Remove pretzels from fridge. Dunk one of the pretzels, top side down, into the lye solution. Use a wooden or plastic spoon as necessary to keep the pretzel submerged for 30-40 seconds. Remove the pretzel, and let it drip for a second or two, then place on the rack right-side-up. Repeat with all pretzels

- pretzel salt
Sprinkle pretzels with salt, then place them right-side up back on the silicone mat.  Bake for 12-14 minutes until dark brown.  Let cool for 5 minutes, then serve immediately.

Dispose of the lye water safely. For example, dump in into a 5 gallon bucket, then fill the rest of the bucket with water, then dump the water outside.
