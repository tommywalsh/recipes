Cake Frosting

This American buttercream recipe tries to balance the better taste of butter with the better consistency of shortening.

- 1 stick butter
Let butter come to room temperature before starting

- 1 cup shortening
In a stand mixer with paddle, mix on low speed until well-mixed.

- 2 lb powdered sugar
Separate 1 lb sugar for later. Gradually add the other 1 lb to the butter mixture. Mixer speed can vary between low (when sugar is first added) to medium (to fully mix)

- 1 Tbsp vanilla
- pinch salt
- 4-6 Tbsp milk
Blend in vanilla, salt and 4 Tbsp milk until smooth.

Gradually add in the rest of the sugar and blend well until very smooth. If necessary, add some/all of the reserved 2 Tbsp milk to thin.
