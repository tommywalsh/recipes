Soft Italian Bread

- 1/2 cup very warm water (110-120F)
- 4.5 tsp yeast
- 4.5 tsp sugar
Combine water, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and quickly whisk together. Let stand for 5 minutes, at which point the water should be foamy.

- 2 cups lukewarm water (80-100F)
- 4.5 tsp olive oil
- 2.25 tsp table salt
Add water, oil and salt to the existing water mixure and give a quick stir.

- 720g bread flour
Add about half of the flour to the water mixture and mix in with a wooden spoon.  Then, add remaining flour, and use the stand mixer to knead for about 5 minutes.  The dough should be very wet and sticky, but it should not drip.

Place dough on a very well-floured surface and use a bench scraper to fold the dough overitself a few times: Pick up the right side and fold it back, then press down. Then repeat with the back, left and front sides. Dust top with flour and cover with plastic wrap.  Let dough rest for 10 minutes.

Repeat the last step 5 more times, folding and resting the dough. Total resting time should be about an hour.

Divide dough into two roughly-equal pieces. Roll each into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Gradually roll the rectangle into a snake, stretching the dough taut with each roll. Pinch the ends together and tuck under.

Place loaves on a silicone pad on a baking sheet. Dust tops with flour, cover with plastic, and let rest for 30-45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425F

- 1 egg
- 1 Tbsp water
Whisk together the egg and water. Brush all over the tops of both loaves. Cut 4-5 diagonal slashes in tops of loaves, then bake in oven for 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes, reduce heat to 375F and rotate pan.  Continue to bake for 15-20 minutes more, until bread is nicely browned. Interior of bread should be between 190F and 200F.

Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.  Loaves can be frozen indefinitely.
