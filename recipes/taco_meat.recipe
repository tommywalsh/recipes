Taco Meat

- 1 lb 80/20 ground beef
Heat a skillet on medium-high. Add beef. Stir and break up meat until it is fully browned and in small pieces.

- 14 g homemade taco seasoning
- 3/4 cup water
Sprinkle seasoning atop meat, add water. Stir to combine, and scrape up any fond from the skillet. Bring to a light boil, stirring regularly, until almost all of the water has boiled off.
