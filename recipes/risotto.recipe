Risotto

- 2 oz parm-regg cheese
Shred cheese and reserve.

- 3.5 cup chicken stock
Warm up so it's hot but not boiling. Hold at that temperature

- 1 onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 Tbsp butter
Meanwhile, dice the onion and garlic. In a large saucepan, melt the butter, then sweat the onions down with a little bit of salt, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook just until aromatic, about 30-60 seconds.

- 1.5 cup arborio rice
Add rice to onions in saucepan. Stir well to coat all grains with a bit of the fat, then toast until some of the grains are just beginning to get slightly browned.

- 1/2 cup white wine
Deglaze pan with wine, and stir well. Cook until wine is completely absorbed and/or evaporated.

Add a ladel of hot stock to the rice, stir well. Continue to stir occasionally to prevent the bottom from scortching. When all of the stock is absorbed, add another ladel. Keep going until all of the stock is absorbed.

Taste for doneness. Rice should not be crunchy at all. Keep cooking until all crunchiness/dryness is gone. Add some tap water if mixture is getting too dry.

- 2 Tbsp butter
- 1.5 tsp lemon juice
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- salt and pepper
+ cheese
Remove rice from heat. Cut up butter into a few small pieces, add to rice, and stir until melted. Add lemon juice and cheese and stir until cheese is all melted and incorporated. Stir in cream, then add salt and pepper to taste.
