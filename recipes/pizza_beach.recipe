Salisbury Beach Pizza

- 3 cloves garlic
Peel and throughly crush the garlic.

- 2 Tbsp olive oil
Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering.

- 1/4 cup tomato paste.
Cook the garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Then, add the tomato paste. Cook, stirring, for another 45 seconds or so.

- 2 cups plain marinara sauce
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 tsp oregano
- dash red pepper flakes
Add sauce, water, sugar, oregano, and pepper to garlic/paste mixture. Bring to a bare simmer and hold the simmer for 15 minutes. Allow to cool a bit.

Preheat oven to 475F

- 24 oz store-bought pizza dough
Roll and/or stretch dough out to roughly 10x15 rectangle. Cover with plastic and let rest/shrink for 5 minutes.

After the quick rest, re-stretch the dough again, re-cover and rest.

- 2 Tbsp olive oil (appx)
Rub a sheet pan with oil, then transfer the dough to the pan. Stretch dough to edges/corners of pan. Re-cover and let rest. Repeat as necessary until dough stops shrinking back away from the edges.

- 3 oz shredded pizza/mozzerella cheese
+ sauce 
Spread sauce evenly over dough, then sprinkle with cheese (the cheese will be sparse).

Bake for 15-20 minutes, until crust bottom is golden-brown.

- 12 slices provolone cheese
Remove pizza from oven. Tile cheese slices stop pizza. Return to oven for about a minute, until the provolone just barely starts to melt. Remove from oven and serve.
