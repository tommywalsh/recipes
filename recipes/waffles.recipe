Waffles

This recipe makes about 4 waffles. Since waffles can only be cooked one at a time, preheat oven to 200F for keeping waffles warm while continuing to make more.

- 1 stick butter
Melt butter over low heat (don't let it sizzle or brown)

- 360g all-purpose flour
- 3-3/4 tsp (1-1/4 Tbsp) baking powder
- 1 tsp kosher salt
Whisk together in a medium bowl


- 2 eggs
Separate eggs, putting yokes into a large bowl and whites into a small bowl

- 2 cups milk
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla paste
+ melted butter
Add butter, milk, sugar, and vanilla to large bowl with the egg yolks. Whisk until uniform.

Gradually add flour mixture to milk mixture while whisking, until batter is uniform.

+ egg whites
Whisk egg whites until foamy, then gently fold into batter.

Set waffle iron to about 80% power, wait for it to warm up, and coat with cooking spray. Scoop about 3/4 cup batter onto waffle iron (enough to cover one side). Cook until lightly browned and fully cooked through, about 4 minutes.

Store cooked waffles on a wire rack in preheated oven.
