Chocolate Chip Cookies

- 2 sticks butter
- 2 eggs
Bring butter and eggs to room temperature.

- 11.5 oz bar chocolate of various types (3:1 dark:milk works good)
Roughly chop chocolate into chunks of about 1 inch or so.

- 150 g sugar
- 165 g light brown sugar
+ butter
Add butter and both sugars to the bowl of a stand mixer with paddle.  Mix at low speed until combined. Then, cream at medium speed for a seemingly-excessive amount of time, occasionally scraping down bowl and paddle. Mixture will be appear creamed after 3-4 minutes, but keep going for 5-7 minutes more (for a total of 8-11 minutes). Mixture should be extremely light and aerated.

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
+ eggs
In a small bowl, whisk together vanilla and eggs until mixture is uniform, and goes not glop when dripping off the whisk.  With the mixer on low, drizzle the egg mixture gradually into the butter mixture. Keep mixing until well-combined, occasionally scraping down bowl and paddle.

- 150 g bread flour
- 140 g all-purpose flour
+ chocolate
Stir together flour and both chocolates.  Add flour mixture to butter/egg mixture. Pulse mixer on low speed with until mostly combined.  Remove bowl from mixer and gently fold the dough by hand with a rubber spatula just until there is no dry flour visible.

Cover dough with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap right down to the surface of the dough so there is no air in between. Refrigerate overnight, or at least 3 hours.

Preheat oven to 350F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, then use a medium cookie scoop to portion out cookies onto each baking sheet, leaving 2-3 inches in between.  Use your palm to slightly flatten out each ball of dough.

- Flaky salt
Bake one sheet at a time. Cookies will be done in 12-16 minutes. Just after baking, sprinkle cookies with flaky salt and let cool completely on a wire rack.

Store in an airtight container.
