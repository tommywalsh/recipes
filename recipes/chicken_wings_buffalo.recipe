Fried Buffalo Wings

- about 12 full wings (or 24 pre-cut half-wings)
- salt
Cutting at the joints, separate each wing into three pieces: drumette, flat, and tip.
Discard the tips, or save them for another use.
Pat wings dry, sprinkle with salt, and arrange on a wire rack.
Let rest 30 minutes, flip them over, pat and sprinkle them again, and wait another 30 minutes

- vegetable oil
Fill a medium pot or wok with enough oil to deep fry, and heat oil to 375F. Preheat oven to 175F

- flour
Pat wings dry. In a medium bowl, lightly sprinkle them with flour and toss until wings are very lightly coated.
The flour here is used to dry the surface, not to act as a breading, so go sparingly.

Working in two batches, fry the wings until they are golden brown (about 10 minutes per batch).
Hold the temperature between 325-350F.
Dry cooked wings with paper towels. Store the first batch in the oven while you do the second batch.

- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/2 cup Frank's hot sauce
Meanwhile, melt butter over low heat. Stir in hot sauce until uniform.

In a large bowl, pour sauce over wings and toss until coated evenly.

- celery
- blue cheese dressing
Serve immediately with celery and dressing on the side.
