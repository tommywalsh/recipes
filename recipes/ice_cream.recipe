Ice Cream Technique

This is more of a technique than a recipe.
Exact details will vary based on desired flavor -- this will tolerate pretty large modifications with amount of sugar or eggs, or with the cream/milk ratio.
This makes a small batch, but a double batch is a little too much for our ice cream maker.

Put ice cream maker and meatloaf pan (or similar) in freezer well ahead of time.

- Flavoring to steep (optional)
If you have a flavoring that needs to be steeped in the milk/cream, then do that first.

- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 tsp table salt
Separate egg yolks. Discard whites (or save for another use)
In a medium bowl, vigorously whisk sugar, salt and egg yolks until smooth and pale yellow.

- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup skim milk
- Flavorings to heat (optional)
Pour egg mixture into a small saucepan. Gradually whisk in milk and cream. Add any other flavorings that need to be heated.

- Non-volatile flavorings (optional)
Heat mixture on medium, stirring regularly, until mixture reaches 170F. Immediately remove from heat.
Strain mixture into large bowl. Add any remaining non-volatile flavorings.
Cover with plastic wrap (press wrap against surface of liquid) and refrigerate overnight or until thoroughly chilled.

- 1/2 Tbsp vanilla extract (optional)
- other volatile flavorings (optional)
Stir in vanilla extract and/or any other volatile flavorings.

- mix-in flavorings (optional)
Churn in ice-cream maker for 20-25 minutes until it reaches soft-serve consistently.  In the last couple minutes, add any "mix-in" chunky flavorings.

- swirl-in flavorings (optional)
Scrape into pre-chilled pan. Add in any "swirl" ingredients.  Cover and freeze 2-3 hours, or until set.

For salty oreo, increase salt to 5g and add about 12 crumbled oreos as mix-ins.
For smoked caramel, add a few drops of liquid smoke to caramel sauce over heat. Let caramel cool as much as possible, then add as a swirl-in. Use thin swirls.
