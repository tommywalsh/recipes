Braised Carrots

- 1 lb carrots
Peel carrots and cut into 1/4 inch slices.

- 2 Tbsp butter
- 1/4 cup water
- 2 Tbsp maple syrup
Put carrots, butter, water and maple syrup in a medium saucepan.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Cover, turn heat to high and bring to a boil.

Turn heat down to simmer, and cook, still covered, for 5 minutes.

Uncover and raise the heat a bit, until water has boiled off.

Lower heat and continue to cook until carrots are of desired tenderness.
