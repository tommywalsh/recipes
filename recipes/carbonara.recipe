Carbonara

- 18g parmesan cheese
Grate or finely shred cheese.

- pepper
Freshly grind 3.5 to 4.5 g of black pepper.

- 1 lb rigatoni
Cook to al delte according to package instructions. While cooking, continue with next steps.  After rigatoni is cooked, drain and reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water.

- 1/4 lb pancetta or guanciale
Cook pancetta in a large skillet over medium-low heat, stirring as needed. Cook until fat has rendered, but before meat is very brown.
Pour into a sieve over a small bowl and drain. Reserve drippings.  Transfer meat to large bowl.

- 8 eggs
Separate 7 of the eggs and discard whites. Add the 7 yolks, plus 1 whole egg to the meat, then whisk until eggs are mixed uniformly.

Add pasta, meat drippings, and 2 Tbsp pasta water to egg/meat mixture and stir to combine. In three batches, add cheese and stir until melted. Add pepper while stirring.  Toss until sauce thickens. If necessary, add more pasta water to thin.
