Grilled Turkish Chicken Thighs

- 4 cloves garlic
Peel and finely mince garlic. Place minced garlic in a large non-metallic bowl.

- 2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1 Tbsp table salt
- 1/2 Tbsp pepper
- 2 tsp cumin
- 2 tsp paprika
- 1/4 tsp cayenne
Add all to the bowl with the garlic. Whisk to combine evenly.

- 6-12 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs.
Using a sharp knife, make a few deep slashes into each thigh, on the skin side.  Add chicken to yogurt mixture and mix to coat thoroughly.

Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (or at least 4 hours).

When it's time to cook, stack all of the coals in one place, so the grill has a hot side and a cooler side.  Oil the grill surface and let it get very hot. Cook the thighs bone-side-down until bottom surface is nicely browned, about 3 minutes. Then turn the thighs and repeat on the other side.

Move the thighs to the cooler side of the grill, and close the grill cover. Cook, turning occasionally, until the thighs reach about 180F, about 20-30 minutes.

Transfer chicken to plate and tent with foil. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
