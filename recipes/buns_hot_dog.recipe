Hot Dog Buns

- 50g bread flour
- water
Bring a small kettle of water to a boil.
Measure out 50g of boiling water, and add it to the flour.
Mix thoroughly, cover, and refrigerate overnight.

- 20g butter
Break butter into small chunks and leave out at room temperature overnight.

- 1 egg
- 4g instant yeast
- 20g sugar
- 6g salt
- 150g milk
Separate egg and save white for later.
In a large bowl, combine yolk, yeast, sugar, salt and milk. Whisk until uniform.

- 250g bread flour
Add flour to milk mixture. Also add refrigerated dough from previous day.
Mix well, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes

Knead dough by hand until it comes together in a smooth ball.
This will take about 6 minutes, and the first few minutes will be really messy.

Press softened butter pieces into the center of the dough ball, and close it up.
Knead for about 3 minutes. This will also get very messy at first, and butter will get everywhere.
Eventually, the dough will reabsorb the butter and the dough will come together.

Form dough into a tight ball, place in bowl, cover, and let rise for 2 to 2.5 hours.

Use a scale to divide the dough into 6 equal portions (it's okay if some portions are made out of multiple small pieces of dough)
Lightly shape each portion into a ball.
Cover balls and let rest for 20 minutes.

Take a ball and press it into a flat rectangle. Roll it into a log, as you would with a jelly roll.
Roll the log against the counter as necessary to stretch it to the desired size)
Repeat with all balls.

Put a silicone mat onto a baking sheet and arrange the buns on the mat.
The buns should be crammed together, side-by-side, like 6 people in the same bed.

Cover the buns and let them rise for 2 more hours.
Near the end of this rise time, preheat the oven to 320F with convection on, and put an empty baking sheet on the bottom rack.

- ice cubes
Brush the tops of the buns with the reserved egg white.
Throw some ice cubes onto the hot tray in the oven.
Bake the rolls on the upper rack for about 25 minutes until the tops are lightly golden.

Remove buns from baking sheet. Place on a rack to cool, so that no moisture can be trapped underneath.

When buns are completely cool, cut them apart with a serrated knife, and also cut a slit in each bun.
Keep covered at room temperature.
