Chicken Marsala

- 6 eggs
Beat eggs in medium bowl

- 300g all-purpose flour
- 100g semolina flour
- 2 tsp salt
Mix flours and salt in large bowl. Add beaten eggs and stir to combine. On a generously floured surface, knead until uniform (it's not possible to overknead). Let the dough pick up enough flour so it is no longer sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.

- more semolina flour for dusting
+ pasta machine
+ coat hangers or similar
Dust counter with semolina. Press dough into flat disk, run it through pasta machine on thickest setting. Fold in half.  Keep running it through machine and folding in half six times.

Decreasing thickeness by one click at a time, run pasta through machine. When it gets too long to handle, cut it in half. Continue up to second-thinnest machine setting.

Use the machine to cut sheets into fettucine noodles. Hang noodles on coat hangers to dry out a bit.

- 8 oz whole white mushrooms
- 1 medium shallot
- 2 medium garlic cloves
Wash mushrooms and cut them into quarters. Dice shallots. Mince garlic.

- 4 chicken breast halves or tenderloins
Lightly pound breasts, but not all the way flat. Cut into strips.

- vegetable oil
- flour
- salt
- pepper
Coat bottom of skillet with vegetable oil, and allow to preheat. Lightly salt and pepper chicken strips. Dredge in flour. Pan-sear chicken until surface is golden (it's okay if chicken is not fully cooked through).  Remove chicken, but leave fat in skillet.

- 1 glug brandy
Add mushrooms to hot oil in skillet, and sprinkle with salt. Add brandy and toss. Sweat until mushrooms have released most of their moisture.  Add shallots and garlic. Keep cooking until shallots are translucent, and mushrooms are browned.

- 2/3 cup chicken broth
- 2/3 cup marsala wine
- 1 or 2 cubes demi-glace (or 1 tsp gelatin)
- 2/3 cup heavy cream
- 2 tsp fresh thyme (or 3/4 tsp dried)
Chop thyme if fresh. Add broth, wine, demi-glace, cream and thyme to skillet with mushrooms. Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer for 10-15 minutes. Boil until reduced by about 1/2.

Meanwhile, bring a salted pot of water to a boil and keep at a slow boil.

Add chicken and any juices to sauce, reduce to a bare simmer, and braise until chicken is fully heated through.  Taste for seasoning!

Cook pasta in boiling water for about 4 miunutes.

Serve chicken and sauce atop pasta.
