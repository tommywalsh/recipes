Marinara Sauce

- 2 28oz cans good quality peeled whole tomatoes
Pour tomatoes into a bowl and crush them well by hand (using gloves, if desired)

- 1 medium yellow onion
Finely mince onion using a food processor (or a knife, if you can cut very small)

- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Heat oil in a large saucepan until a drop of moisture will sizzle when it hits the oil.  Add onions and cook until fully softened and translucent, but not browned, 5-7 minutes.

- 1 small carrot
- 1 celery stalk
Meanwhile, finely mince carrot and celery in a food processor. When onions are cooked, add minced carrots and celery to the onions, and continue cooking until fully softened, 3-5 minutes.

- 4 medium cloves garlic
Meanwhile, finely mince garlic. When vegetables are fully cooked, add garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 30-45 seconds. Immediately add crushed tomatoes.

- 1/4 tsp oregano
- 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper
Add to sauce. Raise heat to bring to a boil, stirring regularly. Reduce heat to maintain a bare simmer. Cook for 30-60 minutes, stirring occasionally.

- 2 Tbsp fresh basil
- salt
- pepper
Finely chop basil. Remove sauce from heat, and add chopped basil. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste.
