Pie Crust

- 225 g all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp kosher salt
Mix together in a medium bowl

- 2 sticks cold unsalted butter
Cut butter into chunks appx 1 Tbsp each. Put one chunk into the flour and smoosh it flat, keeping covered with flour. Repeat for all chunks.

- 1/2 cup cold tap water
Add water to flour mixture, and knead with hands just until a shaggy ball is formed.  Check that temperature is colder than 70F.  If warmer, refrigerate for a bit.

On a very well-floured surface, roll dough out into a 10x15 rectangle. Keep both surfaces generously floured at all times.  Fold short sides into the center, then fold in the middle, so you have four total layers. Then fold once more in the other direction to make eight layers.

For a standard pie, cut block of dough into two equal pieces, and roll each into their final shapes.

Refrigerate for at least an hour before cooking.

The crust expects to be cooked for about 75 minutes. If your pie has no top-crust, you can blind bake the crust a bit before adding the filling to make up any time difference. To do this, place crust in pan, cover with aluminum foil, then fill with table sugar to weigh it down (the toasted sugar will lose its sweetness, but can be reused to weigh down pies)
