Pie Crust (double)

- 225 grams all-purpose flour (about 1-7/8 cups)
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp kosher salt
Whisk these together in a medium bowl

- 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, straight from the fridge
Cut butter into chunks appx 1 Tbsp each. Put one chunk into the bowl, cover it with flour, and smoosh it flat with your hands. Repeat for all chunks. Break up any very large butter pieces still left over at the end. 

- 1/2 cup cold tap water
Add water to flour mixture, and mix with a wooden spoon just until a shaggy ball is formed. Dough will be sticky. Check that temperature is colder than 70F.  If warmer, refrigerate for a bit.

Dump dough onto a very well-floured surface, and sprinkle very generously with flour.  Roll or press dough out into a 10"x15" rectangle, keeping both sides generously floured so they don't stick. Fold short sides into the center, then fold in the middle, so you have four total layers. Then fold once more in the other direction to make eight layers.

Cut the block of dough into two equal pieces.  Roll each piece out roughly into a circle a bit bigger than your pie dish, again keeping it generously floured the whole time.

Let the finished rolled-out dough rest in the fridge for at least an hour before baking. This resting can be done either before or after you add the filling.

The crust recipe expects to be baked for about 75 minutes. So, for example, if you're making a pie that expects to be baked for only 50 minutes, then you should 
"blind bake" the crust on its own for 25 minutes before adding the pie filling. To do this, place crust in pie dish, then cover with aluminum foil. Press the foil tightly against the crust all over, then fill with table sugar to weigh it down. (The sugar will lose its sweetness when baked, but it can be reused to weigh down future pies).
