Fried Chicken

- one 4-ish pound chicken (or separate parts)
Butcher chicken into 10 pieces: 2 wings, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks, 4 half-breasts. Leave skin in place where possible, remove breast meat from bones. Discard or save rest of chicken.

- 4 tsp kosher salt
- 4 tsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
Mix together, then toss with chicken until coated. Place chicken in zip-top bag and refrigerate overnight.

Next day, remove chicken from fridge, pat dry, arrange on rack and return to fridge to dry out.

- vegetable oil
Heat oil in wok or saucepan to 350F, preheat oven to 225F.

- 3 cups flour
- 2/3 cup cornstarch
- 2 Tbsp paprika
- 2 Tbsp garlic powder
- 2 Tbsp onion powder
- 2 tsp cayenne pepper
Mix together in wide-bottomed bowl

- 2 eggs
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 1/2 cup hot sauce (e.g. Frank's)
Whisk eggs, then combine with buttermilk and hot sauce in a container that chicken can be dunked in.  Add 1/3 of this liquid mixture to the dry mixture and mix, which should make some clumps.

Dredge each piece of chicken in the liquid, then cover with breading and return to rack.

In batches, fry chicken pieces until they reach 160F, trying to keep oil between 300-325F. Blot dry with paper towels, then store in oven until ready to serve.
