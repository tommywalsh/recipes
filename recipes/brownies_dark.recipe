Dark Chocolate Brownies

Preheat oven to 325F.
Spray an 8x8 baking dish, then line with parchment, leaving a few inches overhang as "handles", then spray the parchment.

- 1 stick butter
Melt butter and then let cool slightly.

- 75g (3/4 cup) Dutch-process cocoa powder
- 275g (1 1/4 cup) sugar
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
Sift cocoa into a medium bowl, and whisk in sugar and salt.

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
While whisking constantly, pour in butter in a slow steady stream, then vanilla, then one egg, then the other.

- 40 g all-purpose flour
Add flour and stir just until combined. Do not overmix.

Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top.

Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Let brownies cool completely in pan before lifting them out using the parchment. Can be cut into 9, 12 or 16 brownies.
