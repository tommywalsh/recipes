Preheat oven to 350F. Grease a 9x9 pan.

- 2 sticks butter
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium low heat. Let all of the moisture boil off, until the butter turns golden brown and smells nutty.

- 1 lb dark brown sugar
Pour brown butter into a large bowl, add brown sugar and whisk until smooth. Allow to cool for 5 minutes.

- 2 eggs
- 2 Tbsp vanilla extract
Whisk in eggs and vanilla.

- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 255 g all-purpose flour
Whisk in salt, then baking powder. Then gradually whisk in all of the flour.

- flaky sea salt (optional)
Pour batter into greased baking sheet. Sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until a toothpick comes out without wet batter sticking, 25-35 minutes.

Allow to cool completely in the pan, then remove from pan and cut.
