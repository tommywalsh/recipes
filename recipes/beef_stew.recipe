Beef Stew

- 4 cups chicken stock
- 4 cubes demi-glace
- 8 oz frozen pearl onions
Defrost these items beforehand as necessary.

Preheat oven to 300F.

- 3 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1 Tbsp fish sauce
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
Put stock and demi glace into blender. Add paste, fish/soy/Worcester sauces. Blend at high speed until homogenous.

- 3 lbs boneless chuck roast (short rib, bottom sirloin flap, oxtail, or point brisket also work)
Cut roast into steaks about 1.5" thick. Season steaks on both sides with salt and pepper.

- 2 Tbsp veg oil
- salt
- pepper
Heat oil in large dutch oven until shimmering.  Cook steaks until well-browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Work in batches if necessary. Remove steaks to plate.

- 10 oz white button mushrooms or similar
Cut mushrooms into quarters (or sixths if large). Cook in dutch oven until water is expelled and mushrooms have browned. Stir and scrape regularly to release browned steak residue from bottom of pan.

- 3 medium carrots
Peel and chop carrots. Add carrots and pearl onions to mushrooms and cook until slighly browned. Remove everything from pan and reserve.

- 1 large yellow onion
- 2 medium carrots
- 3 medium cloves garlic
- 2 stalks celery
Peel garlic, but no need to peel anything else. Split carrots lengthwise to give a flat surface.  Cut onion in half. Place carrots and onion in pot, flat side down. Add celery and garlic, and try to make as much contact with bottom as possible. Cook until vegetables are somewhat browned.

- 1 cup dry red wine (or sherry, or dry vermouth)
Add wine, a little at a time, and scrape up all of the browned bits in the pan. Cook until wine is reduced by 3/4 or so.

Add broth mixture and bring to a simmer.

- 20g all-purpose flour
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 sprigs thyme
Cut steaks into 1.5" cubes. Reserve any juices from plate. In a large bowl, toss beef cubes with flour. Optionally, tie thyme sprigs together with twine. Add beef, reserved juices, bay leaves, and thyme sprigs to Dutch oven, and return to simmer.

- Place Dutch oven in preheated oven, with the lid partially open. Cook for 90 minutes.

- 1lb Yukon gold potatoes (or similar)
Peel and cube potatoes. Remove stew from oven. Using tongs, remove and discard the carrot, celery, thyme, bay leaves, onion, and garlic.  Add potatoes and the previously-sauteed vegetables. Return to a simmer on stovetop.  Put stew back in oven and cook for one more hour.

- 4oz frozen peas
- salt
- pepper
Remove from oven and place on stovetop. Boil as necessary to achive desired thickness. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add peas.
