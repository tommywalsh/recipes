Crispy Roast Potatoes

- 3 baking potatoes (target 1 lb each)
Preheat oven to 450F. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Peel potatoes and cut into 6-8 pieces of roughly similar size.  

Place cut potatoes into boiling water and let cook for 10 minutes.

- 200 g fat (first choice duckfat, then shortening, then canola)
Place fat into metal pan (9x9 or so), and place in oven to heat up for 5-7 minutes or so.

Drain water out of pot, leaving potatoes in hot pot. Allow to stand for 5 minutes to steam out excess water

- 1 Tbsp kosher salt
- 2 Tbsp semolina flour
Mix together salt and semolina and sprinkle over potatoes. Put lid on pot and shake vigorously 5 times to roughen up surface of potatoes.

Remove hot pan from oven and carefully place potatoes into pan one-by-one, turning to coat all surfaces with hot oil.

Cook potatoes for 25 minutes.  Then turn potatoes and cook for 10 more minutes. Turn again, and continue cooking for as long as needed to fully brown/crisp surfaces (0-15 more minutes).

Dab dry with paper towels and toss with plenty of salt.
