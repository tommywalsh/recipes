French Fries

- 2 medium russet potatoes
Peel and cut potatoes into sticks about 1/4 inch wide.

- 1.5 liters tap water (or enough to cover fries)
- 22.5 mL white vinegar (15mL per liter of water)
- salt
Bring water to boil in pot. Add vinegar and two big pinches of salt. Line a baking sheet with paper towels.

Put fries into boiling water. Adjust heat to just a bare simmer. Cook for about 10 minutes. Fries should be tender but not falling apart.

Remove fries from water with a spider, and spread on paper towels. Allow to dry at least 5 minutes.

- neutral oil
Prepare a fry station, as the first cooking step moves very quickly: Fill saucepan with at least 2 inches of oil, clip on an oil thermometer. Get a stopwatch/timer ready.  Place fries on one side of the pot, and a fresh paper-towel-lined baking sheet on the other.  Turn the oil heat to high.

Working in batches, one spider-load at a time: Load spider with fries. Put fries in oil as soon as oil reaches 400F. Start the timer, and fry for only 50 seconds. Try to keep the oil temperature in the mid-to-high 300s. Scoop the fries out onto the dry paper towels.  Repeat until all fries have been pre-cooked.

Fries may now be frozen in a plastic bag until needed.

Preheat oven to 200F. Prepare fry station again: this time you want a paper-towel lined bowl, and a wire rack atop a baking sheet.  Put 2 inches of oil in a saucepot over high heat, and clip on a thermometer.

When oil temp reaches 400F, put in the first spider load of fries. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the outsides are nicely browned.  Adjust heat as necessary to keep oil temperature in the low-to-mid 300s.  Remove fries to lined bowl, sprinkle with salt to taste.

Repeat with subsequent batches of fries, as desired. As you're cooking each batch, remove the previously-cooked batch from the bowl, add them to the wire rack, and store them in the oven until last batch is done frying.
