Sugar Pie (Tarte au Sucre)

- 1 single-crust pie crust
Place crust in pie pan and put in fridge to rest for about an hour. Near the end of the time, preheat oven to 400F.

This pie will bake for 35-40 minutes, but the pie crust may expect to be cooked longer. Blind-bake the crust to make up the difference (e.g. if crust needs 70 minutes, then blind-bake it for 30-35 minutes)

- 213 g brown sugar
- 30 g all-purpose flour
- 2 Tbsp corn starch
- 1/4 tsp table salt
Whisk together in a large bowl

- 1.5 cups heavy cream
- 0.5 cup maple syrup (not imitation pancake syrup)
Add to dry ingredients and whisk until very well combined

Place pie pan with crust onto a lined baking sheet. Pour filling into crust and cook for 35-40 minutes until the entire pie is bubbling and slightly browned.

Let cool completely before serving. Filling will set as it cools.
