Blueberry Cornbread Cobbler

Preheat oven to 350F

- 160 g frozen corn kernels
- 1 cup buttermilk
In a large measuring cup, use an immersion blender to mix. You want some small chunks of corn, so stop blending before the corn pieces get too small.

- 240g flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
Mix dry ingredients in a medium bowl

- 6 Tbsp cold butter
Cut butter into small chunks. One-by-one, add each chunk to the flour mixture, smooshing the butter with your fingers to disperse it in the flour.

- 1 lemon
Zest lemon, then squeeze it. Measure out 1.5 Tbsp of the lemon juice for the next step

- 800g blueberries (frozen is usually better than fresh)
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp ground coriander
- 40 grams tapioca starch
+ lemon juice
+ lemon zest
Toss everything together in a large bowl until fairly well-combined. If using frozen blueberries, this might not get completely uniform, and that's okay.

In a large stainless steel skillet (cast iron is not recommended due to the acidity), heat the blueberry mixture on medium-low, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is all melted and the blueberries are thawed.
Raise the heat to medium-high until it starts boiling, stirring as necessary to prevent scortching. When the mixture thickens, remove it from the heat.

Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture, and stir until there are no more dry bits left.

Using your fingers, or a spoon, place small dollops of the dough atop the blueberry mixture. It's better to have a thin layer with almost-full coverage than it would be to have a sparse thick layer of dough.

Place skillet in oven, and bake for 40-50 minutes, until golden.

Allow skillet to cool after baking. It's okay to serve this slightly warm, but not hot.

- 3 Tbsp honey
- 3 Tbsp butter
- salt
Melt butter and honey with a pinch of salt, mixing them well together. Brush over surface of cobbler just before serving, then sprinkle the cobbler with flaky salt.

Recommended to serve with vanilla ice cream and/or whipped cream.
