Blueberry Pie

- 28 oz fresh or frozen blueberries (mixed types, if possible)
- 1.5 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt (or 1/4 tsp table salt)
- 1/4 tsp ground coriander
- 40g tapioca starch
In a large bowl, use a flexible spatula to toss blueberries, lemon juice, sugar, salt, coriander, and tapioca starch until well-combined.

- Pie crust (enough for bottom and lattice top)
Place crust into a glass pie pan. Fill with blueberry mixutyre. Assemble a lattice top.

Refrigerate assembled pie for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, put oven rack in lower-middle position, and preheat to 400F.

- 1 eggs
- 1 Tbsp heavy cream or milk
- 1 pinch kosher salt
Separate one egg and discard the white.
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, the egg, cream, and salt.
Brush over lattice in a thin, even coat.

Place pie on a foil-lined half-sheet pan (filling will likely bubble over and spill).
Bake just until crust is golden, 45 minutes to an hour.

Loosely tent pie with aluminum foil and continue cooking until all filling is bubbling, even in the very center. This might be about 15 minutes, but can vary considerably.

Cool until filling reaches at most 85F (about three hours) before serving.
