Blueberry Pie

- 800g blueberries (frozen is usually better than fresh)
- 1.5 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt (or 1/4 tsp table salt)
- 1/4 tsp ground coriander
- 40 grams tapioca starch
Toss together in a large bowl until well-combined. If using frozen blueberries, let this warm up on the counter for about 20 minutes, then give it another stir.

- 2 pie crusts (enough for bottom and lattice top)
Place one crust into a glass pie pan. Fill with blueberry mixture. Cut the other crust into strips and make a lattice top for the pie. Pinch/roll/snip as necessary to seal the top and the bottom together, and make sure the dough will not hang over the edge of the pie pan.

Refrigerate assembled pie for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, put oven rack in lower-middle position, and preheat to 400F.

- 1 egg
- 1 Tbsp heavy cream or milk
- 1 pinch salt
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, cream, and salt.
Brush over lattice in a thin, even coat.

Place pie on a foil-lined half-sheet pan (this contains the mess, as the filling will likely bubble over and spill).  Bake just until crust is golden, 45 minutes to an hour.

Loosely tent pie with aluminum foil and continue cooking until all filling is bubbling, even in the very center. This might be about 15 minutes, but can vary considerably, depending on your oven and the initial temperature of the blueberries.

Cool at room temperature before serving. Wait for temperature to be under 85F, or else it will be soupy.
