American Chop Suey

- 1 medium yellow onion
- 1 green pepper
Finely chop onion and green pepper.

- Olive Oil
Heat olive oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat until hot.
Use just enough oil to cover bottom of saucepan.
Cook onion and green pepper in oil until softened, about 8 minutes

- 1 lb 80/20 ground beef
- 1/2 lb hot italian sausage
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (up to 2 tsp for extra spicy)
Remove sausage meat from casings, if necessary.
Add meat, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, red pepper flakes and a little ground pepper to the cooked vegetables. Cook until meat is browned, about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally.

- 28 oz crushed tomatoes
- 30 oz tomato sauce
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1/2 Tbsp sugar
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar and cinnamon and stir together well.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a light simmer. Cook uncovered and stir occasionally for an hour.

- 1 lb box large elbow macaroni
Meanwhile, use another saucepan to cook pasta in boiling water. Cook for about 2 minutes less than the package says. Rinse pasta with cold water. Try to time this so the pasta is done at the same time as the sauce.

Add pasta to sauce and stir thoroughly. Cook on low heat about 10 more minutes.
