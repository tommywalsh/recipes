Steak Fajitas

- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup lime juice
- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 55g brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp chili powder
- 3 medium garlic cloves
- 2 tsp ground cumin
Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and stir to mix. Separate out 1/2 cup and set aside for later.

- 2 lbs skirt steak (hanger, sirloin tip, or flank steak work too)
Cut steak crosswise into 5- or 6-inch-long slices.  Place meat into a gallon-size plastic zip bag, and add the marinade.  Zip up and refigerate for 3 to 10 hours, flipping bag over every once in a while.

- 3 large bell peppers (any mix of colors)
- 1 large white or yellow onion
Remove stem and seeds from peppers. Cut into half-inch strips. Peel the onion and cut ino half-inch strips.  Put peppers and onions into a large bowl and mix with the reserved marinade. Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook.

Cook steaks over charcoal on grill, or on a wire rack under broiler in oven, turning every minute or so.  Cook until steak reaches desired temperature (115-120F med-rare, 125-130F medium).  Tent with foil and let rest for 10-15 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook vegetables in a preheated cast-iron skillet, either on stove, or on cooler side of grill.  Cook until vegetables are soft and starting to char.

- flour tortillas
- shredded cheese
- sour cream
- lettuce
- any other desired toppings
Heat tortillas in microwave for a few seconds until warm and soft.

Cut steaks into narrow strips. Ideally, cut at a 45-degree angle to the grain of the meat. Scrape any released juices into vegetable skillet and mix.  Serve immediately.
