Italian Sausage

- 1 Tbsp salt
- 1 Tbsp black pepper
- 1 Tbsp garlic powder
- 1 Tbsp dried basil
- 2 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp crushed red pepper flake (or more to make hot sausage)
- 1 1/4 tsp dried parsley
- 3/4 tsp ground fennel
- 1/4 tsp brown sugar
- 1/4 tsp dried oregano
- 1/4 tsp dried thyme
In a medium bowl, combine salt, black pepper, garlic powder, basil, paprika, red pepper, parsley, fennel, brown sugar, oregano and thyme. Stir until very well combined.

- 3 lb ground pork
- 3 Tbsp red wine vinegar
In a large bowl, add 1 lb of the pork, then spread 1/3 of the spice mixture evenly over top, then add 1 Tbsp vinegar.
Repeat two more times until all ingredients are used.
Use gloved hands to thoroughly mix until spices are evenly distributed throughout the pork.

Optionally, fry a small pinch of the mixture to test seasoning, and adjust if necessary.

Wrap in plastic and put in refrigerator for at least 12 hours.

Sausage meat can be bagged and frozen.
