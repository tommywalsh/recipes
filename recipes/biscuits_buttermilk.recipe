Buttermilk Biscuits

Place rack in center of oven. Preheat oven to 450. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.

- 1 stick butter (1/4 lb)
Melt butter (don't let it sizzle or brown). Once melted, remove from heat and let cool while buttermilk also cools.

- 1 cup buttermilk (or 4 Tbsp powdered buttermilk and 1 cup water)
If using powdered buttermilk, sift it into the water and mix very well.
Place buttermilk in a small bowl and put in freezer. Let chill for 10 minutes.

- 245g flour (2 cups)
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 tsp table salt
In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.

Slowly pour butter into buttermilk, stirring vigorously. You should get a bunch of small butter globules dispersed in the super-cold buttermilk.

Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients, and stir with a rubber spatula until just combined. Dough should be wet!

Generously flour the countertop, and coat your hands in flour. Dump dough onto counter, and sprinkle some flour on top of the dough. Use your hands to spread out dough on the counter so that it forms a square roughly 8 inches on each side.

Fold dough into thirds in one dimension. Then fold in half in the other dimension. Repeat once.

Shape dough into a rectangle of roughly uniform thickness.  Use a bench scraper or knife to trim off the very edges of the rectangle (otherwise the edges will not be able to rise very well).  Cut into 6-8 rectangular pieces.

Place dough pieces on baking sheet, and bake for about 12-15 minutes until biscuits are desired level of brownness.

- 1 Tbsp butter
Meanwhile, melt butter over low heat (don't let it sizzle!)

Brush cooked biscuits with melted butter and serve hot.
