Buttermilk biscuits

Place rack in center, preheat oven to 450. Line baking sheet with parchment.

- 1 stick butter
Melt butter (don't let it sizzle or brown). Once melted, remove from heat and let cool while buttermilk also cools.

- 1 cup buttermilk (or 4 Tbsp powdered buttermilk and 1 cup water)
If using powdered buttermilk, sift it into the water and mix very well.
Place buttermilk in a small bowl and put in freezer. Let chill for 10 minutes.


- 245g flour (2 cups)
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 tsp table salt
In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.

Slowly pour butter into buttermilk, stirring vigorously. You should get a bunch of small butter globules dispersed in the super-cold buttermilk.

Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients, and stir with a rubber spatula until just combined. Dough should be wet!

On a generously floured surface, spread/roll out dough a bit so it forms a square roughly 8 inches on each side.
Fold into thirds in one dimension. Then fold in half in the other dimension. Repeat once.

Shape dough into a rectangle of roughly uniform thickness.
Use a bench scraper to trim edges, then cut into 6-8 pieces.


Melt butter. Place dough pieces on baking sheet, and bake for about 12-15 minutes until biscuits are desired level of brownness.

- 1 Tbsp butter
Meanwhile, melt butter over low heat (don't let it sizzle!)
Brush biscuits with melted butter and serve hot.
