Sauteed Zucchini

- 2 pounds zucchini or summer squash
Cut squash into 1/4 inch thick slices.

- 3 Tbsp butter
Place butter into large skillet and melt over medium heat until the foam subsides.
Add zucchini to butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Move squash occasionally for about 5 minutes, trying to get some color on both sides of each squash slice.

Cover squash and reduce heat a bit.
Cook for about 8 minutes, until squash is cooked through, but not soggy.

- 1 Tbsp honey
Uncover, drizzle with honey, and cook for a few more minutes to allow some of the moisture to boil off and for the honey to cook a bit.
