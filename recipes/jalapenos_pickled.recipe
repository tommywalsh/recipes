Pickled Jalapenos

- 7-8 jalapenos
Cut off both ends of each pepper and discard. Slice into thin disks.

- 2 cloves garlic
Peel and smash the garlic

- 1 cup white vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp salt
Heat and stir in a medium pot until everything is evenly combined. Add garlic, then bring to a boil.

Once boiling, remove from heat and add jalapenos. Let sit for 10 minutes.

Using a slotted spoon, move jalapenos only to a small jar. Pass cooking water through a screen to remove seeds and garlic. Add just enough cooking water to jar to cover jalapeno slices.

Refrigerate overnight. Can be kept in fridge for two months.
