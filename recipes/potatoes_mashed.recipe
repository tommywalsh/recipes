Mashed Potatoes

- 2 lb baking potatoes
Either peel or wash potatoes, depending on whether you want skins in the dish or not.
Cut potatoes into quarters, or sixths if they are very big

Put potato pieces into a large pot and cover with cold water. Add a big pinch of salt.
Bring to a boil and hold at a simmer until potatoes are soft but not falling apart, about 30 minutes.

Drain water from pot, then mash potatoes according to how creamy/lumpy you want them.

- 3 Tbsp butter
- milk
Return pot to stove on low heat. Stir in butter until melted and fully mixed.
Add milk, a little at a time, until desired consistency is reached.
