Fluffy Yellow Cake


- 8 oz butter
- 4 large eggs
A few hours before starting, take butter and eggs out of the fridge to warm up to room temperature.

Preheat oven to 325F.
Separate yolks from whites.

- 360g cake flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
Sift flour, baking powder, and baking soda into a medium bowl.
Add salt and whisk to combine.

+ 2 9-inch cake pans
Cut a length of paper towels, and a length of aluminum foil to be a bit longer than the circumference of a pans. Cut each lengthwise into two strips. Repeat so you have two strips each.

Wet paper towels. Make a long, thin "sandwich" with foil on the outside and wet towels on the inside. Each should be just as wide as a cake pan is tall. Wrap them around pans, ensuring that they are tight enough to stay in place, and that none of the foil goes under the pan.

Spray bottom and sides of pans. Cut parchment rounds to cover the bottoms of the pans, nestle the parchment into the pan, then spray top of parchment.

Weigh each empty pan and note the difference in weights.

- 2 cups sugar
+ butter
In a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar on medium-high until creamy and pale, scraping down bowl and beater as necessary, about 3 minutes.

+ egg whites
Meanwhile, in a separate small bowl, whip egg whites to stiff peaks.

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
On medium speed, beat yolks into butter mixture, one at a time, ensuring everything is well mixed before adding the next yolk.  Scrape down bowl, add vanilla and mix well.

- 1 cup buttermilk
On low speed, add a third of the flour mixture and beat until smooth. Then, half the buttermilk. Then the next 1/3 of the flour mixture, then the rest of the buttermilk, then the rest of the flour mixture. Scrape down bowl and beater.

Fold in egg whites until mixture is mostly uniform.

Use a scale to help distribute the batter equally into the two pans, taking account of the weight difference from earlier.

Bake for about 40 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean in the center, and near the sides.

Let pans cool on counter for about 20 minutes, then remove cakes from pans, and allow them to cool completely on wire racks.
