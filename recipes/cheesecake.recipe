Cheesecake

- NOTES
This recipe is for a chocolate flavor, but this recipe is very adaptable to other flavors with substitutions.

-450g cream cheese
Soften completely before beginning. This can be done overnight on the counter, or by immersing a sealed container in warm water. Do not use cold cream cheese.

Preheat oven to 320F.

- 50g butter
Melt butter (don't let it boil/sizzle)

- 150g Oreos (or Vienna Fingers, graham crackers, etc.)
Pulse cookies in food processor until fully crumbled. Place crumbles in a medium bowl, pour butter over top, and mix thoroughly.

Cut parchment to fit the bottom of a pan. (A springform pan works great for this, but a pie plate or small brownie pan can work too)
Press cookie mix to cover the bottom the pan, on top of the parchment.

- 225g sweetened condensed milk
- 3 eggs
- 15g vanilla
In a large bowl, mix the milk, eggs and vanilla together with the softened cream cheese. Use a hand whisk at first, then a blender or immersion blender to make completely uniform. Pour cheese mixture atop the cookie mix in the pan.

- 50g Oreos (or substitute)
Break each Oreo into 3-5 pieces, and place the pieces into the cheese mixture. Use a fork or spoon to press them into the mixture (they might pop back up to the surface, which is okay).

Bake cheesecake for about 40-50 minutes. Remove when a thermometer measures 175F.

Allow cheesecake to cool in pan for at least 15 minutes.

- NOTE
The next steps make a chocolate ganache. This can be swapped out in favor of dulche de leche, caramel sauce, etc.  In any case, make sure the topping is warm enough to be easily pourable, but also make sure it is thick enough so that it will not be runny after being chilled.

- 150g heavy cream
- 150g chocolate
Chop the chocolate. In a small saucepan, bring cream just to a bare boil. Add chopped chocolate and whisk until all the chocolate is melted. Pour ganache over the cheesecake to fully cover the top.

- 50g Oreos (or substitute)
Pulse cookies to crumbs in food processor as before. Dust top of cheesecake with the crumbs.

Refrigerate cheesecake until full chilled.
