Pan Sauce

Make after searing meat in a skillet.

- small shallot or other allium
- 1 pat butter or other fat
Remove finished meat from skillet and cover with aluminum foil to rest. Mince shallot into evenly-sized pieces. Melt butter in just-used skillet until it bubbles. Add shallots. Cook until tender, adjusting heat so that shallots do not brown or burn.

- 1 Tbsp or so flour (optional)
Use flour only for gravy-like sauces. For thinner sauces, omit flour. Sprinkle flour atop shallots and stir. Control heat so that the flour does not burn (the flour may pick up color initially due to absorbing dark oil/fluid from the pan, but should not brown further).  Cook just until flour starts to smell of pie crust (2-3 minutes)

- vinegar (optional)
- wine (optional)
- soy sauce and/or Worcestershire sauce (optional)
Add a splash of whatever flavoring liquid(s) you want, and stir, scraping up pieces of the fond left behind by the meat.

- broth or water
- any drippings from resting meat
Add liquid gradually, scraping up all of the fond. Boil down to desired consistency.

- salt
- pepper
- 1 pat cold butter
Season to taste, then vigrously whisk in the butter until it is entirely melted. Serve immediately.
