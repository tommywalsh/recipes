Roasted Chicken

- 1 whole chicken
Spatchcock the chicken: Remove any giblets. With the breast side down, use strong shears to cut out the backbone by snipping along either side. Flip the bird back breast-side up and break or snip the breastbone so that the bird splays out flat. Fold the wing tips under so that they don't burn in the oven. Discard the giblets and backbone (or reserve for stock)

- kosher salt
Pat the skin completely dry, put the chicken on a wire rack over a baking sheet, sprinkle generously with salt, and place in the refrigerator uncovered for a day or so.

Preheat oven to 450F.

- About 1/3 cup of solid fat (bacon grease, clarified butter, shortening)
- 4 sprigs thyme (or dried)
- 4 sprigs rosemary (or dried)
Finely chop rosemary and thyme. Combine it with the fat and mix well.
Use your fingers to separate the skin from the meat, creating four large pockets, one each over the breasts and thighs. Wiggle your fingers down to make the pocket as big as possible. Fill these pockets with the herb/fat mixture, and press down on the skin to spread it around evenly.

- olive oil
- pepper
- cayenne
Pat chicken dry, then brush olive oil over the skin.  Sprinkle skin with pepper and cayenne.

Place chicken on a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet.  Bake until deepest part of breast reaches 165F (usually 45-70 minutes, depending on size of bird)

Allow to rest for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
