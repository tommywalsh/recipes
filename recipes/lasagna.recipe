Lasagna


- 1 small onion
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 lb Sweet Italian sausage
Peel and mince onion and garlic (but keep them separate). Remove sausage meat from casings.

- ¾ lb Ground beef (85/15 works well)
- olive oil
In a dutch oven, add just enough oil for a very thin coating. Heat on medium, then cook sausage and ground beef until well-browned, breaking up with a spoon or masher. Remove meat with a slotted spoon and reserve.

- salt
In the same pot, over medium-low heat, sweat the onions until they are translucent but not browned. Add garlic and cook for about a minute or so until fragrant but not browned.


- 28 oz crushed tomatoes
- 13 oz tomato sauce
- 12 oz tomato paste
- ½ cup water
Add tomato products and water to onions and garlic, add reserved meat, and bring to a boil. Lower heat to a bare simmer.


- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp chopped fresh parsley (or 2tsp dried parsley)
- 1½ tsp dried basil leaves
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning
- ½ tsp fennel seeds
- ¼ tsn ground black pepper
- salt to taste
Stir in spices and simmer, covered, for about 90 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.

- 16 oz ricotta cheese
- 1 egg
- 2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley (or 1tsp dried parsley)
Mix ricotta, egg and parsley in a small bowl. Cover and set aside.

Preheat oven to 375F.

- 12 lasagna noodles
Cook noodles in salted water according to package directions. Try to time this so they are done at approximately the same time as the sauce.  Noodles can be stored in cold water until needed.

- ¾ lb mozzarella cheese (shredded or sliced)
- ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
In a 9x13 baking dish, layer the lasagna. Figure out how many layers you will have (this depends on noodle size).
Start with meat sauce on the bottom, then noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and finally parmesan. Repeat as appropriate, using approximately equal amounts of each ingredient each time.

1 hour and 10 minutes before dinner time, spray some aluminum foil, and cover the lasagna (spray side down!).
Bake for 50 minutes, removing the foil after 25 minutes.

Allow lasagna to rest for 15 minutes before cutting and serving.
