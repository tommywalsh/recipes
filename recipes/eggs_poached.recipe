Poached Eggs

Place about an inch of water in a deep, small skillet. Bring to a boil.

- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp white vinegar
Add salt and vinegar, and reduce heat until just barely boiling.

- 2 eggs
One at a time, break eggs into a small shallow bowl and slip them into the water.
Spoon a little water over the top of the eggs, and cover.

Cook 3 to 5 minutes, just until white has set and yolk has filmed over.

Remove with a slotted spoon and serve immediately.
