Whipped Cream (optionally stabilized)

Place bowl and whisk attachment of a stand mixer into the freezer for at least 10 minutes.

- 1 tsp unflavored gelatin (optional)
- 4 tsp water (optional)
If stabilizing, put water into a very small microwave-safe container, sprinkle gelatin on top and let sit for a few minutes until bloomed. Microwave for 5 seconds or so to dissolve the gelatin fully.

- 1 cup heavy cream
- 30 grams (about 1/4 cup) powdered sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
Combine the cream, vanilla, and sugar in chilled bowl.
Whip on high speed in a stand mixer until soft peaks form.
If stabilizing, reduce speed to low and gradually pour gelatin mixture into the cream
Continue whipping on high speed until stiff peaks form.
