Buttermilk Biscuits

Preheat oven to 450F. Like baking sheet with parchment.

- 1 stick butter
- 1 cup buttermilk
Melt butter and remove from heat. Put buttermilk in freezer. Let rest for 5-10 minutes.

- 245 g flour
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 tsp table salt
Whisk together in a large bowl

Slowly pour melted butter into super-cold buttermilk, whisking vigorously the whole time. This will produce a bunch of dispersed little globules of butter in the buttermilk.

Add wet mix to dry mix and stir with a rubber spatula just until combined. If the dough is too wet to stick together, add some more flour.

On a generously floured surface, spread/roll out dough a bit so it forms a square roughly 8 inches on each side. Fold into thirds in one dimension. Then fold in half in the other dimension. Repeat once.

- 2 Tbsp butter
Melt butter.

Shape dough into a rectangle of roughly uniform thickness. Use a bench scraper to cut into 6-8 pieces. Places pieces on baking sheet, and brush with melted butter.

Cook for about 15 minutes until browned as desired.
