Bolognese

- 125g parmesan
Grate cheese using chopping blade of processor.

- 2 Tbsp water
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1 lb lean ground beef
- ground pepper
Mix soda with water and stir until dissolved. Put beef in a medium bowl, add soda water, and pepper to taste. Mix will with hands.

- 6 oz pancetta
- 1 carrot
- 1 stalk celery
- 1 small onion
Peel carrot and onion. Chop carrot, celery and onion.
Using chopping blade, pulse pancetta about 15 times until it forms a sticky ball. Add chopped veggies and pulse about 15 more times until a paste is formed.

- 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 Tbsp butter
Heat butter and oil in dutch oven until foaming starts to subside. Add pancetta paste and pepper to taste.
Cook until moisture is driven off, about 8 minutes.
Then, spread paste over bottom surface, and continue cooking for about 10 more minutes until very well browned.
Scrape and stir often to prevent fond from burning, and to allow all parts to spend some time on the bottom.

- 4 cups beef broth
Meanwhile, boil beef broth until reduced in half, to 2 cups. (If you go too far, add water to top up to 2 cups)
Also, get a pot of salted water up to a bare simmer to get ready to cook pasta later.


- 3 Tbsp tomato paste
When pancetta/veggie mix is fully browned, move it to the side of the pan, and add paste to the middle. Let cook for about 3 minutes.
Then, add beef mixture, stirring and scraping regularly until meat is well-browned.


- 1 cup red wine
When beef is fully browned, gradually add wine, and use it to deglaze. Stir well until wine has reduced and assimilated into the sauce.
Then, add reduced beef broth, and 1/2 of the grated cheese. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes (or longer).

- 1 lb wide noodles, such as tagliatelli or peppardelle
Meanwhile, cook pasta one minute less than package recommends for "al dente". Drain and reserve at least 1 cup of pasta water.


Season sauce with salt and pepper if needed. Add pasta to meat sauce and toss well.  Keep over medium heat for about 2 minutes, stirring regularly.
Use reserved pasta water to thin sauce as needed, as the pasta will absorb some moisture and thicken the sauce.
