Crab Cakes

- 1 lb canned lump crabmeat
Drain crabmeat. Place half of it in a large mixing bowl, and reserve the other half for later.

- 1 egg
- 1/3 cup mayo
- 1/2 cup panko (or more)
- 2 Tbsp dijon mustard
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 4 dashes Tabasco
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- salt
- pepper
Beat egg. Add egg, mayo, panko, mustart, Worcestershire, Tabasco, and paprika to bowl with crabmeat.  Add salt and pepper to taste, and stir until thoroughly combined. Add more panko as necessary until mixture just comes together.

Gently fold in the remainder of the crabmeat. Be gentle so you don't break apart these pieces as you fold.

Form mixture into patties and arrange on a sheet of parchment. Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet until bubbling (try not to burn the butter).  Fry patties for about 10 minutes, flipping and rotating as necessary to get a good browning on both sides.
