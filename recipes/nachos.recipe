Nachos

- Canned sliced black olives
- Pickled jalapenos
- Sour cream
- About half a small jar of chunky salsa
Remove olives and jalapenos from their liquid. Put sour cream into a squirt bottle or piping bag.  Open salsa jar and get a spoon ready. Keep these ingredients handy as you will want to access them quickly after the nachos come out of the oven.

Put a rack about six inches under the broiler, and turn the broiler on so the oven heats up.

- 1/2 lb jack or cheddar cheese
Shred cheese using food processor. Do not buy pre-shredded cheese as it will not melt well.

- 1 can refried beans
Remove beans from can, heat in microwave just enough to be warm, and break up so it's no longer can-shaped.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper

- 1 large bag restaurant-style tortilla chips
- nacho cheese sauce from 1/2 lb of cheese
- taco meat from 1 lb of ground beef

Spead out half of the chips onto the baking sheet. Top with half each of the shredded cheese, beans, cheese sauce, and taco meat. Try to distribute these as evenly as possible across all of the chips.  Repeat with a second layer.

Place under the broiler until the cheese is melted and the exposed edges of the top chips have just begun to brown.

Remove from oven. Sprinkle olives and jalapenos evenly across top. Spoon salsa globs evenly across top.  Drizzle with sour cream. Serve immediately.
