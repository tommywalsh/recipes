Clam Linguini

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Try to use the minimum amount of water necessary for 1 lb of pasta, because we want the water to be as starchy as possible when the pasta is done.

- 4 cloves garlic
- 19.5 oz (3 cans) minced clams
Peel and mince garlic. Drain clams, reserving all drained liquid.

- 1/4 cup olive oil
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic and cook just until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Don't brown the garlic.

- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 tsp salt
Add the reserved clam juice, along with the white wine and the salt, to the garlic. Bring to a boil and continue to cook for about 10 minutes, boiling off about half the liquid, to make the sauce.

- 1 lb linguini
Meanwhile, cook linguini in the boiling water just to "al dente" (probably 9 minutes). Reserve all cooking water after pasta is done! This recipe only uses 3/4 of the pasta, so set aside 1/4 of it as leftovers.  

Add about 1/2 cup of the cooking water to the boiling sauce, and continue to boil that down a little bit.

- 1 Tbsp dried parsley
- crushed red pepper flakes to taste
Reduce heat to medium-low. Add clams, parsley, and pepper flakes to sauce, and let cook just until clams are warmed through, about 30 seconds.

Add pasta to sauce and swirl around to mix the clams evenly, and coat all of the pasta with the sauce. Allow to sit for a minute or two so the pasta can absorb some of the sauce.
