Scrambled Eggs

1 tsp tapioca starch
1/2 Tbsp water
Whisk together in medium bowl until no clumps remain

2 Tbsp cold butter
Break into small chunks. Split into two groups of appx. equal size.

2 eggs
salt
Crack eggs into bowl with starch mixture. Whisk until no longer gloppy.
Add half of the butter chunks and whisk to mix.

Put a tablespoon or so of water into a nonstick pan. Heat it on medium-high,
swirling the pan around until most of the water evaporates.

Add remaining butter chunks, and wait for butter to melt. Then, egg mixture and continually stir/fold them with a spatula until they 
are cooked a little less than your desired consistency (15 seconds to 2 minutes). Remove to a plate and
serve immediately. Eggs will finish cooking off heat in the time it takes you
to get the plate to the table.
