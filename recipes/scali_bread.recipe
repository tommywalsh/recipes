Scali Bread

- 120g all-purpose flour
- 1 pinch instant yeast
- 1/3 cup cool water
Mix in a small bowl to make a starter. Cover with plastic, and let rest at room temperature overnight.

- 240g all-purpose flour
- 8g salt
- 2 Tbsp dry milk
- 2/3 cup lukewarm water
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
Put the starter in the bowl of a stand mixer, add the above ingredients, and beat until dough comes together. This will take a while, as the dough is fairly wet.

Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, cover with plastic and let rest for 90 minutes.

Separate dough into 3 pieces of roughly the same size, and shape each into a rough log. Allow to rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes.

Place a silicone pad on a baking sheet. Roll each piece into a log about 2 feet long, and lay them side-by-side on the silicone pad. Squeeze the three pieces together at one end, braid them all together, then squeeze together the other ends.  Cover with plastic and let rest at room temperature for 90 minutes.

Near the end of the rest time, preheat the oven to 375F.

- 1 egg 
- splash water
- sesame seeds
Separate egg and discard yolk. Whisk egg white and water, and brush over top of loaf. Sprinkle on plenty of sesame seeds. Bake for 25-30 minutes until top is browned to the desired amount, and the internal loaf temperature is at least 160F.
