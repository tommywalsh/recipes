Popcorn

- popcorn salt
Popcorn salt can be made by putting regular table salt in a blender, high enough to cover blades completely. Blend until salt has been powdered. Popcorn salt will keep indefinitely.

- 65 g clarified butter
Melt clarified butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.

- 1/4 cup popping corn kernels
Place four kernels into melted butter. Raise heat to medium and cover pan.  As soon as two of the kernels pop, immediately remove pan from heat.

Add all of the remaining kernels to the pot, and re-cover. Allow to sit, off heat, for 1 minute.  This will bring the temperature of the kernels close to popping temperature.

Return pot to medium heat. Place cover on pot, slightly ajar to let steam escape.  Kernels should start popping soon. Stand back from pot, as butter and/or kernels can fly out of the pan at any time.

Once popping has stopped, remove lid, and dump popcorn into a large bowl. Sprinkle thoroughly with popcorn salt.
