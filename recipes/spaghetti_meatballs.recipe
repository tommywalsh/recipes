Spaghetti and Meatballs

Preheat oven to 300F

- 10-12 meatballs (see separate recipe)
Reserve in fridge until needed

- 1 onion
Grate onion using food processer with small-holed shredding disk. Reserve 1/2 cup of the grated onion (discard the rest)

- 2 garlic cloves
Finely mince garlic

- 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
Heat oil in large oven-safe saucepan until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until fully softened, about 7 minutes.

- heaping 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes
- heaping 1/4 tsp oregano
- 2 cups tomato juice
- 28oz crushed tomatoes
- 1/8 cup white wine
- 1/2 tsp salt
- pepper
Add minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and oregano to onion. Cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Stir in juice, crushed tomatoes, wine, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, stirring regularly. Lower heat to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes.

Gently add meatballs to sauce, immersing them as much as possible. Cover saucepan and place in oven. Cook for an hour.

- 1 box spaghetti
Cook spaghetti according to package directions, coordinating so that pasta is finshed at the same time as sauce.

- 2/3 tsp basil leaves
- 1 tsp parsley
- sugar
- salt
- pepper
After removing meatballs from oven, add basil and parsley. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper to taste.

Meatballs and sauce may simply be poured over spaghetti. Alternatively, remove meatballs from sauce, stir together spaghetti and sauce, then serve meatballs atop sauced pasta.
