Crispy Tortellini

- 3 thin slices prosciutto
Heat large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.
Cook prosciutto in a single layer until browned and curling, then turn and cook other side (about 2 mins per side). Transfer to paper towel to drain and cool.


- 1-2 Tbsp olive oil
- 14oz frozen tortellini
Add oil to skillet and let it heat up.
Add tortellini in a single layer. Cook for 2-4 minutes until browned.

- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 1/3 cup water
Sprinkle peas atop tortellini, add water and cover (it will sputter and hiss).
Steam for about 5 minutes, when water should have cooked off.
If water cooks off earlier, add a bit more.

- 3 Tbsp mascarpone (or creme fraiche)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
Scoop pasta into large bowl, add mascarpone and lemon, crumble prosciutto over top, then toss to combine.
