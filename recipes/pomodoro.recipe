- 1 red onion
- 1 carrot
- 6 cloved garlic
Trim, halve, and peel onion. Peel and roughly chop carrot. Peel and smoosh garlic.

- 28 oz whole peeled tomatoes
Using gloves, break up tomatoes in a large bowl.

- salt
Heat oil in saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and a pinch of salt. Cook until just starting to brown.

- 1 parmesan rind
- 1 shake basil
Add tomatoes, onion, carrot, and parmesan. Try to nestle these in so they are mostly covered by the tomatoes.
