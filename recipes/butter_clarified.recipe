Clarified Butter

- Butter
Each stick of butter will yield approximately 85 grams, or 3â…“ ounces of clarified butter.

Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat (A medium saucepan works good for 3-6 sticks of butter).

Increase heat a bit. You want the heat just high enough so that the butter bubbles but no higher. Otherwise, the milk solids will brown/burn, and that will ruin the taste.  Stir the butter occasionally to prevent any milk solids from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

+ Sieve
+ Cheesecloth
After a while, the bubbling will effectively stop, signaling that the water has been boiled off.  Fold a piece of cheesecloth into 4 layers, and use it to line a sieve.  Pour butter through the cloth-lined sieve into a bowl.  The milk solids will be caught in the cloth/sieve, and only clarified butter will make its way into the bowl.

Optionally, divide the butter into indidividal servings in separate small bowls.  (One batch of popcorn uses about 65 grams).

Place the bowl(s) of butter into the fridge overnight to harden.  After hardening, the butter can be removed from the bowl and stored in plastic bags.  These will last indefinitely in the fridge.
