Apple Squares

- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
Carefully heat milk in the microwave just until it is lukewarm, not hot. Beat together the milk and eggs.

- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 500 g all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 sticks cold butter
In a large bowl combine yeast, flour and salt. Using two knives or a pastry cutter, cut in butter until mixture is the consistency of coarse crumbs.

Add milk mixture to flour mixture, stirring until a soft dough forms.

Divide dough in half, wrap with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

- 3 lbs tart apples (e.g. Granny Smith)
Peel and core the apples and slice very thinly

+ 13x18 pan
Lightly grease a 13x18 pan, and cut a piece of parchment paper to about 12x17.
Roll half the chilled dough onto the parchment paper. Flip the paper over to transfer the dough to the pan.
Peel off the paper, and do any necessary repairs on the dough.


- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 tsp cinnamon
Spread apples over the dough in the pan, leaving a small border. Mix together sugar, cornstarch, salt, and cinnamon, then sprinkle evenly atop apples.

Repeat the rolling procedure with the other half of the dough, and place it atop the apples.  Pinch together the two pieces of dough to seal along each edge.
Cut steam vents in top dough.
Cover with plastic wrap. Use a bit of nonstick spray on the wrap to ensure no sticking.

Preheat oven to 350F
Let covered pastry rise for 1 hour at room temperature

Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.

Cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes.

- 115 g powdered sugar
- 2 Tbsp heavy cream
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
Mix sugar, cream and vanilla until smooth. Drizzle evenly over pastry. Allow to cool completely so that glaze will set before cutting into squares.
