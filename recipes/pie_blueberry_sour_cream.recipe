Blueberry Sour Cream Pie

- 180 g Nilla Wafers
Pulse in a food processor to the consistency of coarse bread crumbs

- 6 Tbsp butter
Melt butter, but don't let it sizzle. Pour atop crushed wafers and pulse until it just starts to hold together.  Press into a 9" pie plate to make a crust. Set aside in fridge

- 6.66 g gelatin
water
In a very wide-bottomed heatable container, add just barely enough water to coat the bottom. Sprinkle gelatin on top and let it bloom.

- 400g sour cream
- 100g light brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
Combine together in medium saucepan. Over low heat, stirring constantly, raise to be very warm, 130F or so, but do not allow to boil.  Remove from heat.

Lightly heat up gelatin/water mixture, stirring until it is liquid and gelatine is fully dissolved. Add to sour cream mixture and stir well.

Pour mixture into pie crust and return to fridge.

- 6 Tbsp butter
- 160 g light brown sugar
In a small saucepan, melt butter but do not allow to sizzle. Stir in sugar and dissolve. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Allow to boil, still stirring, for 1 minute.  Pour atop pie to cover sour cream, but do not mix with the sour cream.
